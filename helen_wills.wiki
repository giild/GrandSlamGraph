'''Helen Newington Wills''' (October 6, 1905 – January 1, 1998), also known as '''Helen Wills Moody''' and '''Helen Wills Roark''', was an American [[tennis]] player. She became famous around the world for holding the top position in women's tennis for a total of nine years: 1927–33, 1935 and 1938.<ref name=Collins2008/> She won 31 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament titles (singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles) during her career, including 19 singles titles.

Wills was the first American woman athlete to become a global celebrity, making friends with royalty and film stars despite her preference for staying out of the limelight. She was admired for her graceful physique and for her fluid motion. She was part of a new tennis fashion, playing in knee-length pleated skirts rather than the longer ones of her predecessors. Unusually, she practiced against men to hone her craft, and she played a relentless game, wearing down her female opponents with power and accuracy. In 1933, she beat the eighth-ranked US male player in an exhibition match.

Her record of eight wins at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] was not surpassed until 1990 when [[Martina Navratilova]] won her ninth. She was said to be "arguably the most dominant tennis player of the 20th century",<ref>{{cite web|author=Finn, Robin|title=Helen Wills Moody, Dominant Champion Who Won 8 Wimbledon Titles, Dies at 92|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0D71F31F930A35752C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|date=1998-01-03|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> and has been called by some (including [[Jack Kramer]], [[Harry Hopman]], [[Mercer Beasley]], [[Don Budge]], and AP News) the greatest female player in history.<ref name="Kramer">{{cite book | title=The Game: My 40 Years in Tennis | publisher=G.P.

==Early life==
[[File:Helen of California by Haig Patigian.jpg|thumb|"Helen of California", a portrait sculpture by [[Haig Patigian]], on display at the [[de Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco]]]]

She was born as Helen Newington Wills on October 6, 1905, in [[Centerville, Alameda County, California]] (now [[Fremont, California|Fremont]]), near [[San Francisco]]. She was the only child to Clarence A. Wills, a physician and surgeon at [[Alameda Health System|Alameda County Infirmary]] and Catherine Anderson, who had graduated with a B.S. degree in Social Science at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].{{sfnp|Cherry|2018|p=16|ps=}}{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=61|ps=}} Her parents had married on July 1, 1904 in [[Yolo County, California]].{{sfnp|Cherry|2018|p=16|ps=}} She lived in the small town of [[Byron, California]], and practiced her tennis game at the Byron Hot Springs resort.<ref>{{cite book |title=Brentwood |last1=Jensen |first1=Carole A. |author2=East Contra Costa Historical Society |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=116 |isbn=978-0738558257 |year=2008 |series=Images of America}}</ref> 

She was tutored by her mother at home until she was eight years old.{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=61|ps=}} After her father enlisted in the military in December 1917 and was posted in France with the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] her mother enrolled her at [[Rock Point School|Bishop Hopkins Hall]] in [[Burlington, Vermont]].{{sfnp|Cherry|2018|p=17|ps=}} When World War I ended the family moved back to Northern California, to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], where they took up residence near [[Live Oak Park (Berkeley)|Live Oak Park]].{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|pp=65-66|ps=}} Wills enrolled as a ninth-grader at the [[Anna Head School]], a private day and boarding school, where she graduated in 1923 at the top of her class.{{sfnp|Cherry|2018|p=18|ps=}}{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=61|ps=}} Wills then attended the University of California, Berkeley, as both her parents had done, on an academic scholarship, and graduated in 1925 as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honor society.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://berkeley.edu/tour/students/famous_alumni2.html | title = UC Berkeley Online Tour: Famous Alumni | accessdate = 2010-07-01 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527100153/http://www.berkeley.edu/tour/students/famous_alumni2.html | archivedate = 2010-05-27 }}</ref>

When she was eight years old, her father bought her a tennis racket and they practiced on the dirt courts next to the Alameda County Hospital as well as at Live Oak Park.{{sfnp|Cherry|2018|p=21|ps=}}{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=62|ps=}} Wills' interest in tennis was kindled after watching exhibition matches by famous Californian players including [[May Sutton]], [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]] and her particular favorite, [[Maurice McLoughlin]].{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=65|ps=: "There is no other player in tennis history that I would rather have seen than McLoughlin at his best, how thrilled I was when I took up a tennis ball for his famous signature."}}

In August 1919, she joined the Berkeley Tennis Club as a junior member on the advice of tennis coach Wiliam "Pop" Fuller who was a friend of her father.{{sfnp|Cherry|2018|p=21|ps=}}{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=66|ps=}}<ref name="cdt19330904">{{cite news|title=The warfare between the Helens|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1933/09/04/page/21/article/the-warfare-between-the-helens|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=September 4, 1933|pages=21–22}}</ref> In the spring of 1920, she practiced for a few weeks with [[Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman]], four-time winner of the U.S. Championships singles title, on strokes, footwork and tactics.{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=71-73|ps=}}

In September 1921, Wills won the singles and doubles titles at the California State Championships, defeating [[Helen Baker (tennis)|Helen Baker]] in the final in three sets.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Hardy|editor1-first=Samuel|title=Spalding's Tennis Annual|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066623905;view=1up;seq=203|date=1922|publisher=American Sports Publishing Co.|location=New York|page=191|quote=The surprise of the tournament was the defeat of Miss Helen Baker by Miss Helen Wills.

Wills also won two [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals in Paris in 1924 ([[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Women's singles|singles]] and [[Tennis at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Women's doubles|doubles]]), the last year that tennis was an Olympic sport until 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hazel Wightman and Helen Wills – Tennis at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv11n2/johv11n2j.pdf|work=Journal of Olympic History – Volume 11 – Number 2|publisher=International Society of Olympic Historians|accessdate=2017-01-03|author=Patricia Henry Yeomans|pages=19–23|date=June 2003|via=[[LA84 Foundation]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Don Skene|title=Miss Wills, Richards, win Olympic net titles|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1924/07/21/page/1/article/miss-wills-richards-win-olympic-net-titles|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=July 21, 1924|page=1}}</ref> Wills was the U.S. girls' singles champion in 1921 and 1922.

Wills was reported to be introverted and detached. On court, she rarely showed emotion, ignored her opponents, and took no notice of the crowd.<ref name="Story page 32">{{cite book |author=[[Billie Jean King]] with Cynthia Starr |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wehavecomelongwa00king/page/32 32] |isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://archive.org/details/wehavecomelongwa00king/page/32 }}</ref> [[Kitty McKane Godfree]], who in 1924 inflicted the only defeat Wills suffered at Wimbledon during her career, said, "Helen was a very private person, and she didn't really make friends very much."<ref name="Story page 32"/> [[Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman]] said, "Helen was really an unconfident and [socially] awkward girl—you have no idea how awkward....

She typically wore a white sailor suit having a pleated knee-length skirt, white shoes, and a white visor.

On February 16, 1926, the 20-year-old Wills met [[Suzanne Lenglen]], six-time Wimbledon champion, in the final of a tournament at the Carlton Club in [[Cannes]] in the [[Match of the Century (tennis)|Match of the Century]]. It was the only time they played each other in singles competition. Public anticipation of their match was immense, resulting in high scalper ticket prices. Roofs and windows of nearby buildings were crowded with spectators, including King [[Gustaf V of Sweden]]. Both players were nervous, with Lenglen drinking [[brandy]] and water at one point to calm her nerves.<ref name="time">{{cite journal|title=Wills v.

Lenglen turned professional after the 1926 season.

After she returned to the United States, Wills attempted a comeback from her [[appendectomy]], lost two matches, and on the advice of her doctor, withdrew from that year's U.S. Championships. Apart from those two losses, beginning with the [[1923 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1923 U.S. Championships]], Wills lost only four matches in three years: once to Lenglen, twice to [[Kathleen McKane Godfree]], and once to [[Elizabeth Ryan]]. Wills had winning overall records against the latter two. In 1927, a revived Wills began her streak of not losing a set until the [[1933 Wimbledon Championships]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In an exhibition "[[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]]" match in [[San Francisco]] on January 28, 1933, Wills defeated [[Phil Neer]], the eighth-ranked American male player, 6–3, 6–4.<ref name="fein">{{cite journal|last=Fein|first=Paul|date=April 2006|url=http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/0405_bestfemale.html|title=Who is the greatest female player ever?|journal=Inside Tennis|accessdate=2017-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103135840/http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/0405_bestfemale.html|archive-date=2011-01-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="usatoday">{{cite news|url=http://cgi1.usatoday.com/sports/century/012899.htm |date=January 31, 1999 |title=This Day in Sports: January 28 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2007-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151456/http://cgi1.usatoday.com/sports/century/012899.htm |archivedate=2009-06-06 }}</ref>

During the 17-year period from 1922 through 1938, Wills entered 24 Grand Slam singles events, winning 19, finishing second three times, and defaulting twice as a result of her appendectomy. Her streak of winning U.S. Championships seven times in seven attempts ended when she defaulted to [[Helen Jacobs|Helen Hull Jacobs]] during the 1933 final due to a back injury, trailing 0–3 in the third set.

In 1994 in an interview with ''Inside Tennis'' reporter William Simon, she revealed what ended her career:

{{quotation|1='''Helen Wills Moody-Roark''': Well, it was during the war and my husband was at Fort Reilly, Kansas...It was the middle of winter, and I was walking my big police dog, Sultan. A little dog came barking wildly out of a house and grabbed my dog by the throat. Those little fox terriers have no sense. They’re just wild. So my poor dog was being chewed to pieces and wasn’t able to respond. But I wasn’t going to have a dogfight under my feet so I let go of his collar. And then Sultan took this little dog and shook him, which he deserved. But in the fight, my index finger on my right hand was bitten...<br>
'''William Simon''': By the terrier?<br>
'''HWMR''': I don't know. Fury! Wild, stupid animal! But my poor old finger, the finger next to the thumb. The thumb is very important in tennis. So that was the end of my career. I couldn’t manage. I never mentioned this before to anyone.<ref>[http://www.insidetennis.com/0406_first_serve.html Inside Tennis. April 2006. ''For the Love of the Game: 25 Years in Tennis''.

Wills won 31 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament titles (singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles), including seven singles titles at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], eight singles titles at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], and four singles titles at the [[French Open|French Championships]]. Excluding her defaults at the French Championships and Wimbledon in 1926, she reached the final of every Grand Slam singles event she played. She never played at the Australian Championships.

===Awards and honors===
In 1935, she was named [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Female Athlete of the Year]] by the [[Associated Press]].

In July 1926 and 1929, Wills appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helen Wills|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101260726,00.html|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|date=July 26, 1926}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Helen Wills|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101290701,00.html|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|date=July 1, 1929}}</ref>

==Playing style==
When asked in 1941 about whether Wills or Lenglen was the better player, Elizabeth Ryan, who played against both of them in singles and partnered both in doubles, said, "Suzanne, of course. She owned every kind of shot, plus a genius for knowing how and when to use them."<ref name="fein"/> However, Wills and Lenglen are seen as having completely different skills and strategies.<ref>{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofte00robe/page/173 173] |title=The Encyclopedia of Tennis |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofte00robe |url-access=registration |last=Robertson |first=Max |publisher=Viking Press |year=1974 |quote=Helen Wills and Suzanne Lenglen played entirely different styles of tennis.}}</ref> Wills served and volleyed with unusually powerful forehand and backhand strokes, and she forced her opponents out of position by placing deep shots left and right. Lenglen was more physically nimble, and she was more imaginative—able to quickly change shots in response to conditions. Lenglen was a master of the [[drop shot]] and close net work, which was Wills' soft spot. Aware of her weakness at the net, Wills drove her opponents deep into the backcourt as much as possible. Playing Wills was, according to Helen Jacobs, like playing "a machine... with implacable concentration and undeniable skill" yet with little flexibility.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5MIog99qigC&pg=PA74 |pages=73–74 |last=Jacobs |first=Helen |authorlink=Helen Jacobs |chapter=My Matches Against Helen Wills Moody |editor=[[Caryl Phillips]] |title=The Right Set: A Tennis Anthology }}</ref>

Analogizing Wills's game to [[poker]], [[George Lott]], a 12-time winner of Grand Slam doubles titles and a contemporary of Wills, once said, "Helen's expression rarely varied and she always tended strictly to business, but her opponents were never in doubt as to what she held: an excellent service, a powerful forehand, a strong backhand, a killer instinct, and no weaknesses. Five of a kind! Who would want to draw against that kind of hand?"<ref name="fein"/> [[Charlie Chaplin]] was once asked what he considered to be the most beautiful sight that he had ever seen. He responded that it was "the movement of Helen Wills playing tennis".<ref>''My Autobiography'' (1964) – Charlie Chaplin, page 358</ref>{{sfnp|Engelmann|1988|p=71|ps=}}

<sup>1</sup>Through 1923, the French Championships were open only to French nationals (or members of French tennis clubs). The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), actually played on clay in Paris or Brussels, began in 1912 and were open to all nationalities. The results from that tournament are shown here for 1922 and 1923. The Olympics replaced the WHCC in 1924, as the Olympics were held in Paris. Beginning in 1925, the French Championships were open to all nationalities, with the results shown here beginning with that year.

<sup>2</sup> During the 1926 French Championships Helen Wills had an appendectomy that had not healed by the time Wimbledon started. One week before it started, the tournament was informed that she would not play. She was given a default from her opening round match, which Wimbledon does not consider to be a "loss".<ref name="Wimbledon">{{cite web | url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/static/pdfs/archive/players/ebd7e6fd-8e9c-4220-a461-65e85a7ae9b5_LS.pdf | title=Helen Wills (USA): Ladies Singles | publisher=All England Lawn Tennis Club | accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Wills married Frederick Moody in December 1929. She divorced Moody in 1937 and married [[Aidan Roark]] in October 1939. She did not have any children from either marriage and died of natural causes on January 1, 1998, aged 92, in Carmel, California.

Wills wrote a coaching manual, ''Tennis'' (1928), her autobiography, ''Fifteen-Thirty: The Story of a Tennis Player'' (1937), and a mystery, ''Death Serves an Ace'' (1939, with Robert Murphy).<ref>{{cite web|author1=Julie Cart|title=Tennis Legend Helen Wills Moody Dies|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/03/news/mn-4570|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 3, 1998}}</ref> She also wrote articles for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and other magazines.

Senator [[James D. Phelan]] befriended Wills and invited her as a frequent guest to his estate, [[Villa Montalvo]]. Wills wrote poetry as a hobby, and presented two of her works, "The Awakening" and "The Narrow Street", to a literary competition hosted by Phelan in 1926. Wills settled [[laurel wreath]]s over the heads of the winners. Phelan himself wrote a poem dedicated to Wills.<ref>[http://www.sjsu.edu/reading/ADayInTheHills.pdf ''A Day In The Hills''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606234711/http://www.sjsu.edu/reading/ADayInTheHills.pdf |date=2011-06-06 }}, September 18, 1926, Villa Montalvo. Archive at San Jose State University.</ref> In 1928, Phelan commissioned [[Haig Patigian]], sculptor and fellow member of the [[Bohemian Club]], to create a likeness of Wills. Patigian completed a marble bust of Wills in October 1928, and Phelan donated it to the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]]. At his death in 1930, Phelan left Wills $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1930|r=0}}}} today) in his will, "in appreciation of her winning the tennis championship for California".<ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', item from August 16, 1930. Laura Perkins, August 12, 2005, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/12/WBGLRE51QU1.DTL "San Francisco hotel workers ratify three-year contract."] Retrieved on August 4, 2009.</ref>

Wills met painter [[Frida Kahlo]] and her husband [[Diego Rivera]] at the San Francisco studio of her friend sculptor [[Ralph Stackpole]] in 1930. Rivera sketched Wills and asked her to model as the main figure of "California" for the 30-foot-high mural ''Allegory of California'' he was painting for the [[List of traditional gentlemen's clubs in the United States|City Club]] of the [[Pacific Exchange|San Francisco Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Allegory of California by Diego Rivera at the City Club of San Francisco|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/programs/artist-studio/frescoes/allegory-california-diego-rivera-city-club-san-francisco|publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco}}</ref> The committee of the Stock Exchange found out that Wills was being portrayed and insisted that no living person be represented in the mural. Subsequently, Rivera darkened the hair, broadened the eyes, changed the corners of the mouth and angled the jawline to remove any specific resemblance to Wills. A portrait of Stackpole's son [[Peter Stackpole]] holding a model airplane remained unnoticed in the mural.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art Deco San Francisco: The Architecture of Timothy Pflueger |last=Poletti |first=Therese |author2=Tom Paiva |year=2008 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=978-1568987569 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tcUhJJJwCoIC }}</ref>

Wills painted all her life, giving exhibitions of her paintings and etchings in New York galleries. She personally drew all of the illustrations in her book ''Tennis''.

Wills remained an avid tennis player into her 80s.

In 1998, Wills bequeathed US $10 million to the University of California, Berkeley to fund the establishment of a [[Neuroscience]] institute. The resulting institute, the [[Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute]], began in 1999 and is now home to more than 40 faculty researchers and 36 graduate students.
