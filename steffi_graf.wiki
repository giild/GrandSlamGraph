Consequently, Graf's Grand Slam was achieved on grass, clay, and hard court while the previous five Grand Slams were decided on only grass and clay. Graf reached thirteen consecutive major singles finals, from the [[1987 French Open – Women's Singles|1987 French Open]] through to the [[1990 French Open]], winning nine of them. She won 5 consecutive major singles tournaments ([[1988 Australian Open - Women's Singles|1988 Australian Open]] to [[1989 Australian Open - Women's Singles|1989 Australian Open]]), and seven out of eight, in two calendar years (1988 Australian Open to [[1989 US Open - Women's Singles|1989 US Open]], except [[1989 French Open - Women's Singles|1989 French Open]]).

==Early life==
Stefanie Graf was born on 14 June 1969, in [[Mannheim]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[West Germany]], to Heidi Schalk and car-and-insurance salesman Peter Graf (18 June 1938 − 30 November 2013). When she was nine years old, her family moved to the neighboring town of [[Brühl (Baden)|Brühl]]. She has a younger brother, Michael.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.de/20131202/steffis-svengali-peter-graf-dies |title=Steffi's father Peter Graf dies after cancer battle |website=The Local |date=2 December 2013 |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611015950/http://www.thelocal.de/20131202/steffis-svengali-peter-graf-dies |archive-date=11 June 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Her father, an aspiring tennis coach, first introduced her to the game, teaching his three-year-old daughter how to swing a wooden racket in the family's living room.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/06/local/la-me-passings-20131206 |title=PASSINGS: Peter Graf, Robert Dockson |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001081719/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/06/local/la-me-passings-20131206 |archive-date=1 October 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> She began practicing on a court at the age of four and played in her first tournament at five. She soon began taking the top prize at junior tournaments with regularity, going on to win the European Championships 12s and 18s in 1982.

==Career==
===Early career===
Graf played in her first professional tournament in October 1982 at [[1982 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Filderstadt]], Germany. She lost her first round match 6–4, 6–0 to [[Tracy Austin]], a two-time US Open champion and former world No. 1 player. (Twelve years later, Graf defeated Austin 6–0, 6–0 during a second round match at the [[Indian Wells Masters|Evert Cup]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], which was their second and last match against each other.)

At the start of her first full professional year in 1983, Graf was 13 years old and ranked world No. 124. She won no titles during the next three years, but her ranking climbed steadily to world No. 98 in 1983, No. 22 in 1984, and No. 6 in 1985. In 1984, she first gained international attention when she almost upset the tenth seed, [[Jo Durie]] of the United Kingdom, in a fourth round [[Centre Court]] match at Wimbledon. In August as a 15-year-old (and youngest entrant) representing West Germany, she won the tennis demonstration event at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles. No medals were awarded as this was not an official Olympic event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=64473 |title=Steffi Graf: The Golden Slam |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=4 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616133142/http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=64473 |archive-date=16 June 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Graf's schedule was closely controlled by her father, who limited her play so that she would not burn out.<ref name="latimes1987">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-13/sports/sp-7824_1_peter-graf |title=Both on and Off Court, Graf Has Come a Long Way in Past Year |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=13 September 1987 |first=John |last=Feinstein |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829210451/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-13/sports/sp-7824_1_peter-graf |archive-date=29 August 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1985, for instance, she played only ten events leading up to the US Open, whereas another up-and-coming star, [[Gabriela Sabatini]] of Argentina, who was a year younger than Graf, played 21. Peter also kept a tight rein on Graf's personal life. Social invitations on the tour were often declined as Graf's focus was kept on practicing and match play. Working with her father and then-coach [[Pavel Složil]], Graf typically practiced for up to four hours a day, often heading straight from airports to practice courts. This narrow focus meant that Graf, already shy and retiring by nature,<ref name="latimes1987"/> made few friends on the tour in her early years, but it led to a steady improvement in her play.

In 1985 and early 1986, Graf emerged as the top challenger to the dominance of [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Chris Evert]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/sports/sp-9730_1_peter-graf |title=Graf, 16, Can Handle Pressure |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=8 June 1986 |first=John |last=Feinstein |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223012/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/sports/sp-9730_1_peter-graf |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During that period, she lost six times to Evert and three times to Navratilova, all in straight sets. She did not win a tournament but consistently reached tournament finals, semifinals and quarterfinals, with the highlight being her semifinal loss to Navratilova at the US Open.

On 13 April 1986, Graf won her first WTA tournament and beat Evert for the first time in the final of the [[Family Circle Cup]] in [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]. (She never lost to Evert again, beating her six more times over the next three and a half years.) Graf then won her next three tournaments at [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island]], Charleston, and [[Qatar Telecom German Open|Berlin]], culminating in a 6–2, 6–3 defeat of Navratilova in the final of the latter. Illness caused her to miss Wimbledon,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-17/sports/sp-11677_1_steffi-graf |title=Tennis Roundup : Mysterious Illness Forces Graf to Withdraw From Wimbledon |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=17 June 1986 |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223012/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-17/sports/sp-11677_1_steffi-graf |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and an accident where she broke a toe several weeks later also curtailed her play. She returned to win a small tournament at [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] just before the US Open where, in one of the most anticipated matches of the year, she encountered Navratilova in a semifinal. The match was played over two days with Navratilova finally winning after saving three match points 6–1, 6–7, 7–6. Graf then won three consecutive indoor titles at [[Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]], [[Zurich Open|Zurich]], and [[Brighton]], before once again contending with Navratilova at the season-ending [[1986 Virginia Slims Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]] in New York. This time, Navratilova beat Graf 7–6, 6–3, 6–2.

===Breakthrough year: 1987===
Graf's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came in 1987. She started the year strongly, with six tournament victories heading into the French Open, with the highlight being at the tournament in [[Miami Masters|Miami]], where she defeated Martina Navratilova in a semifinal and Chris Evert in the final and lost only 20 games in the seven rounds of the tournament. In the French Open final, Graf defeated Navratilova, who was the world No. 1, 6–4, 4–6, 8–6 after beating Sabatini in a three-set semifinal.

Graf then lost to Navratilova 7–5, 6–3 in the Wimbledon final, her first loss of the year. However, in the [[Fed Cup|Federation Cup]] final in [[Vancouver, Canada]], three weeks later, she defeated Evert easily 6–2, 6–1. The US Open ended anti-climactically as Navratilova defeated Graf in the final 7–6, 6–1.

Graf had a win-loss record of 75-2 for a 97.4 winning percentage in 1987, both losses coming to Navratilova as they split the four matches they played during the year. On 17 August, after defeating Evert in a straight set final in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, Graf overtook Navratilova for the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career, a ranking she would hold for the next 186 consecutive weeks, a record (it was tied by Serena Williams in 2016). Graf was the first player other than Navratilova or Evert to hold the top spot since Tracy Austin in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Lisa Dillman|title=Graf Defeats Evert, Gains No. 1 Ranking|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-17/sports/sp-1036_1_martina-and-chris|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 August 1987|access-date=19 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301063406/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-17/sports/sp-1036_1_martina-and-chris|archive-date=1 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Unprecedented Golden Slam: 1988===
[[File:Seoul women's tennis results.jpg|thumb|Seoul women's tennis results]]
Graf started 1988 by winning the Australian Open, defeating Chris Evert in the final 6–1, 7–6. Graf did not lose a set during the tournament and lost a total of only 29 games.

Graf lost twice to Sabatini during the spring, once on hardcourts in Boca Raton, Florida, and once on clay at [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island, Florida]]. Graf, however, won the tournament in San Antonio, Texas, and retained her title in Miami, where she once again defeated Evert in the final. Graf then won the tournament in [[Qatar Telecom German Open|Berlin]], losing only twelve games in five matches.

At the [[1988 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], Graf successfully defended her title by defeating [[Natasha Zvereva]] 6–0, 6–0 in a 34-minute final.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-07-02-8801120571-story.html | title=Graf wastes no time reaching another final | date=2 July 1988 | first=Phil | last=Hersh | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=25 May 2019 }}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150325101912/http://www.rolandgarros.com/fr_FR/about/history/past_tournaments/1988.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1988 : Steffi Graf était pressée.|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/fr_FR/content/default/1987_1999_steffi_et_le_temps_des_spcialistes.html|website=www.rolandgarros.com|publisher=[[Fédération Française de Tennis]] (FFT)|language=French|access-date=3 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822224621/http://www.rolandgarros.com/fr_FR/content/default/1987_1999_steffi_et_le_temps_des_spcialistes.html|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxT19Jhgy64|title=French Open 1988 Final - Steffi Graf vs Natallja Zvereva|date=26 November 2014|work=YouTube|access-date=4 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713073704/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxT19Jhgy64|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The official time of the match given on the scoresheet was 34 minutes; however, just 32 minutes of that was spent on the court, as a rain break split the match into two periods of play, of nine and 23 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2014/may/27/french-open-1988-steffi-graf-andre-agassi-mats-wilander|title=The 1988 French Open: how Agassi arrived, Graf ruled and Wilander won|first=Steven|last=Pye|work=The Guardian|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref> That was the shortest-ever and most one-sided Grand Slam final ever and the only [[double bagel]] in a Major final since 1911.<ref name="French double bagel"/> Zvereva, who had eliminated [[Martina Navratilova]] in the fourth round, won only thirteen points in the match.<ref name="French double bagel">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DD1138F936A35755C0A96E948260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FG%2FGraf%2C%20Steffi |title=TENNIS; Graf Shuts Out Zvereva to Gain French Open Title |work=The New York Times |date=5 June 1988 |accessdate=17 May 2011 |first=Robin |last=Herman}}</ref>

Next came Wimbledon, where Martina Navratilova had won six straight titles. Graf was trailing Martina Navratilova in the final 7–5, 2–0 before winning the match 5–7, 6–2, 6–1.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Peter Alfano|title=Wimbledon; An Era Ends as Graf Beats Navratilova|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/03/sports/wimbledon-an-era-ends-as-graf-beats-navratilova.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 July 1988|access-date=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130092346/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/03/sports/wimbledon-an-era-ends-as-graf-beats-navratilova.html|archive-date=30 January 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She then won tournaments in [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] and [[United Jersey Bank Classic|Mahwah]] (where she lost only eight games all tournament).

At the US Open, Graf beat Sabatini in a three-set final to win the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] by 6–3, 3–6, 6–1, a feat previously performed by only two other women, [[Maureen Connolly Brinker]] in 1953 and [[Margaret Court]] in 1970. Graf's 1988 Grand Slam remains the only one in history completed on three surfaces (grass, clay, hard court), as all other Grand Slams in tennis history were achieved prior to the introduction of hard court at the US Open in 1978.<ref name="Bleacher Report">{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1536384-forget-calendar-slam-surface-slam-almost-as-rare|title=Forget Calendar Slam, "Surface Slam" Almost as Rare|work=Bleacher Report|date=20 February 2013|accessdate=15 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721160101/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1536384-forget-calendar-slam-surface-slam-almost-as-rare|archive-date=21 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Graf then defeated Sabatini 6–3, 6–3 in the gold medal match at the Olympic Games in Seoul and achieved what the media had dubbed the "Golden Slam".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-01/sports/sp-4214_1_steffi-graf |title=THE SEOUL GAMES : Women's Tennis : Graf Turns Her Slam Into a Golden One |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=1 October 1988 |first=Bill |last=Dwyre |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703022331/http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-01/sports/sp-4214_1_steffi-graf |archive-date=3 July 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The feat has only been achieved by Graf to date. Graf also won her only Grand Slam doubles title that year—at Wimbledon partnering Sabatini—and picked up a women's doubles Olympic bronze medal.

At the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], Graf was upset by [[Pam Shriver]], only her third loss of the year. She was named the 1988 [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]].

At the end of the year, the municipality of Brühl, her hometown, gave her the title of honorary citizen.

====1989====
Speculation was rife at the beginning of 1989 about the possibility of Graf winning another Grand Slam. Some noted observers, such as Margaret Court, suggested that Graf could achieve the feat a couple more times. And the year began as expected, with Graf extending her Grand Slam tournament winning streak to five events at the Australian Open, defeating [[Helena Suková]] in the final. Her 6–3, 6–0 defeat of Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini in a semifinal was described by veteran observer [[Ted Tinling]] as "probably the best tennis I've seen".<ref>"Australian Tennis", March 1989, p. 28</ref> He went on to add, "I saw what Steffi did to Sabatini at the Australian Open this year, and that was it. She is better than them all."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068538/7/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Serving Her Country | date=26 June 1989 | access-date=28 June 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604112009/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068538/7/index.htm | archive-date=4 June 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Graf followed this with easy victories in her next four tournaments at Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas, Boca Raton, Florida, and [[Family Circle Cup|Hilton Head, South Carolina]]. The Washington, D.C. tournament was notable because Graf won the first twenty points of the final against [[Zina Garrison]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DF1131F933A15751C0A96F948260 |title=Graf Trounces Garrison |work=The New York Times |date=20 February 1989 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> In the Boca Raton final, Graf lost the only set she conceded to Chris Evert in their final seven matches.<ref>[http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/playerheadtoheaddetail.asp?PlayerID=50020&x=3&y=6&Player1ID=70044 Head to Head] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226060744/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/playerheadtoheaddetail.asp?PlayerID=50020&x=3&y=6&Player1ID=70044 |date=26 December 2008 }}</ref>

In the subsequent [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island]] final on clay, Graf lost her first match of the year to Sabatini but returned to European clay with easy victories at [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] and [[Qatar Telecom German Open|Berlin]].

Graf's Grand Slam tournament winning streak ended at the French Open, where 17-year-old Spaniard [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] beat Graf in three sets. Graf served for the match at 5–3 in the third set but lost the game and won only three more points in the match. Suffering from food poisoning, she had struggled to beat [[Monica Seles]] in their semifinal 6–3, 3–6, 6–3 and said that she had had menstrual cramps in the final.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Stephen R. |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/50806/SURPRISE-SANCHEZ-BEATS-GRAF.html |title=SURPRISE!

Graf warmed up for the US Open with easy tournament victories in [[Acura Classic|San Diego]] and [[United Jersey Bank Classic|Mahwah]]. In her semifinal match at the US Open, Graf defeated Sabatini 3–6, 6–4, 6–2. The match was notable for its dramatic ending. Having suffered from leg cramps since the middle of the third set, Graf ran off the court seconds after match point to seek medical treatment.<ref>{{cite news |last=Finn |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/09/sports/graf-and-navratilova-march-to-a-showdown.html |title=Graf and Navratilova March to a Showdown |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1989-09-09 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220150129/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/09/sports/graf-and-navratilova-march-to-a-showdown.html |archive-date=20 December 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the final, Navratilova led 6–3, 4–2 before Graf rallied to win 3–6, 7–5, 6–1 for her third Grand Slam singles title of the year.

Victories at Zurich and [[Brighton International|Brighton]] preceded the [[1989 Virginia Slims Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], where Graf cemented her top-ranked status by beating Navratilova in the four-set final. Graf ended 1989 with an 86–2 match record and the loss of only 12 sets. Her 0.977 winning percentage is the second-highest in the open era behind Navratilova.<ref name="wta_spotlight">{{cite web|title=No.1 spotlight: Steffi Graf|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/40love/article/3150587/title/no1-spotlight-steffi-graf|publisher=[[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA)|date=20 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122014432/http://www.wtatennis.com/40love/article/3150587/title/no1-spotlight-steffi-graf|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====1990====
Graf defeated [[Mary Joe Fernández]] in the final of the Australian Open, which was her eighth Grand Slam singles title in the last nine she contested.  She survived an intense 3 set battle with Helena Sukova in the semis, breaking in the 10th and final game to win the 3rd set 6-4. Her winning streak (unbeaten since the 1989 French Open loss to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario) continued with victories in [[Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]], [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island]], and [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]]. Shortly after winning in Tokyo, Graf injured her right thumb while cross-country skiing in Switzerland and subsequently withdrew from the [[Virginia Slims of Florida]] and the [[1990 Lipton Championships|Lipton Championships]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Finn |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/09/sports/graf-is-injured-skiing.html |title=Graf Is Injured Skiing |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1990-02-09 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116010009/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/09/sports/graf-is-injured-skiing.html |archive-date=16 January 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In [[WTA German Open|Berlin]], she extended her unbeaten streak to 66 matches (second in [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] history to Navratilova's 74) before losing the final to Monica Seles, 6–4, 6–3.

While the Berlin tournament was being played, the largest-circulation German tabloid, ''[[Bild]]'', ran a story about an alleged scandal involving Graf's father. The difficulty of answering questions about the matter came to a head at a Wimbledon press conference, where Graf broke down in tears. Wimbledon authorities then threatened to immediately shut down any subsequent press conferences where questions about the issue were asked. Whether this scandal affected Graf's form is open to debate. In an interview with ''Stern'' magazine in July 1990, Graf stated, "I could not fight as usual."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DE163BF930A25754C0A966958260 |title=Tennis; Graf's Toughest Foe: the Press |work=The New York Times |date=13 July 1990 |accessdate=17 May 2011 |first=Ferdinand |last=Protzman}}</ref>

Graf again lost to Monica Seles in the final of the French Open 7–6, 6–4. Seles was behind 2–6 in the first-set tiebreaker, but then came back to win six points in a row and take the set. At Wimbledon, Graf lost in the semifinals to [[Zina Garrison]], who with this victory broke Graf's string of 13 consecutive Major finals. This was a major upset as Garrison had to save a match point to defeat Monica Seles in the quarterfinal, and was expected to easily fall to Graf, whom she had not beaten in 4 years.  After victories in [[Canada Masters|Montreal]] and [[Acura Classic|San Diego]], Graf reached the US Open final, where she lost in straight sets to Sabatini. Graf won four indoor tournaments after the US Open, including a pair of straight set wins over Sabatini in the finals of [[Zurich Open|Zürich]] and [[Virginia Slims of New England|Worcester]]. Although Sabatini got the best of Graf in the semifinals of the season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], Graf still finished the year as the top-ranked player.

====1991====
A mixture of injury problems, personal difficulties, and loss of form made 1991 a tough year for Graf. Seles established herself as the new dominant player on the women's tour, winning the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open and, in March, ending Graf's record 186 consecutive-weeks hold on the World No. 1 ranking.<ref name="wta_spotlight"/> Graf briefly regained the top ranking after winning at Wimbledon but lost it again after her loss to Navratilova at the US Open.

Graf lost an [[1991 Australian Open|Australian Open]] quarterfinal to [[Jana Novotná]], the first time she did not reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament since the 1986 French Open. She then lost to Sabatini in her next three tournaments before winning the U.S. Hardcourt Championships in [[San Antonio]], beating Monica Seles in the final. After losing a fifth straight time to Sabatini in [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island, Florida]], Graf again defeated Seles in the [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] final. Following her tournament victory in [[WTA German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, Graf suffered one of the worst defeats of her career in a [[1991 French Open|French Open]] semifinal where she won only two games against Sánchez Vicario and lost her first 6–0 set since 1984. At [[1991 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], however, Graf captured her third women's crown, this time at Sabatini's expense. Sabatini served for the match twice, and was two points away from her first Wimbledon title. After breaking Sabatini's serve to even the third set at 6–6, Graf defeated Sabatini by winning the next two games to take the match 6–4, 3–6, 8–6. Martina Navratilova then defeated Graf 7–6, 6–7, 6–4 in a [[1991 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] semifinal, the first time she had beaten Graf in four years. Graf then won in Leipzig, with her 500th career victory coming in a quarterfinal against [[Judith Wiesner]]. After winning two more indoor tournaments at Zurich and [[Brighton International|Brighton]], she failed once again in the Virginia Slims Championships, losing her quarterfinal to Novotná. Soon after, she split with her long-time coach, Pavel Složil.

====1992====
A bout of [[rubella]] forced Graf to miss the first major event of 1992, the [[1992 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. Her year continued indifferently with losses in three of her first four tournaments, including a semifinal loss to [[Jana Novotná]] in [[Virginia Slims of Chicago|Chicago]]. It was Graf's second consecutive loss to Novotna, and dating back to their 1991 Australian Open quarterfinal match, Jana had won three of their last five meetings.  It would also be the last loss Graf would ever have to Novotna in a match she completed (she did have a loss after withdrawing with injury after the first set of a late 1996 match).  Chicago was notable, however, for being the first tournament Graf played with her new coach, former Swiss player [[Heinz Günthardt]]. Graf's father had approached Günthardt during the 1991 Virginia Slims Championships.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ziehm|first1=Len|title=Steffi lives it up - New Graf steps out in style|agency=Chicago Sun Times|date=16 February 1992}}</ref> She would work with him for the remainder of her career.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/16/sports/tennis-finally-graf-gets-to-start-her-year.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> In [[Virginia Slims of Florida|Boca Raton, Florida]], Graf reached her first final of the year, where she faced [[Conchita Martínez]] for the title. In their five previous head-to-head matches, Graf had defeated Martínez each time. Even though Conchita won the opening set, Graf went on to prevail in three sets. She lost twice to Sabatini in the early spring at the Lipton International and the Bausch & Lomb Championships, which now brought her to 7 losses in her last 8 matches against Sabatini; however, the Bausch & Lomb loss would be Graf's final loss to Sabatini, winning her next, and last, eight matches against Sabatini.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead/steffi-graf_2255881_2718/0,,12781~2718~7184,00.html |title=WTA &#124; Players &#124; Head to Head &#124; Steffi Graf |publisher=Wtatennis.com |date= |accessdate=1 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017092649/http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead/steffi-graf_2255881_2718/0,,12781~2718~7184,00.html |archive-date=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Victories at [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] and [[WTA German Open|Berlin]] (beating Sánchez Vicario in the finals of both) prepared her for the French Open, where she defeated Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals after losing the first set 6–0. Graf then lost a closely contested final to Monica Seles, 6–2, 3–6, 10–8. Seles won the match on her 5th match point; Graf came within two points of winning the match a few games earlier. At Wimbledon, after struggling through early-round three-setters against [[Mariaan de Swardt]] and [[Patty Fendick]], she easily defeated Natasha Zvereva in the quarterfinal, Sabatini in the semifinal, and Seles in the final 6–2, 6–1, with Seles playing in almost complete silence because of widespread media and player criticism of her [[grunting (tennis)|grunting]]. Graf then won all five of her [[Fed Cup]] matches, helping Germany defeat Spain in the final by defeating Arantxa Sánchez Vicario 6–4, 6–2. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Graf lost to [[Jennifer Capriati]] in the final and claimed the silver medal. At the US Open, Graf was upset in the quarterfinal by Sánchez Vicario 7–6, 6–3. Four consecutive indoor tournament victories in the autumn helped improve her season, but for the third consecutive year, she failed to win the Virginia Slims Championships, where she lost in the first round to [[Lori McNeil]].

===Second period of dominance===
====1993====
Graf began 1993 with four losses in her first six tournaments of the year: two to Sánchez Vicario and one each to Seles and the 36-year-old Martina Navratilova. She struggled at the [[Qatar Telecom German Open|tournament in Berlin]] where she lost a 6–0 set to the unheralded [[Sabine Hack]] before defeating [[Mary Joe Fernández]] and Sabatini in three-set matches to claim her seventh title there in eight years.

During a quarterfinal match between Seles and [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in Hamburg, Seles was stabbed between the shoulder blades by a mentally ill German fan of Graf, Günter Parche. He claimed that he committed the attack to help Graf reclaim the world No. 1 ranking. More than two years elapsed before Seles competed again. Shortly after the stabbing, during a players meeting at the [[1993 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] in Rome, 17 of the world's top 25 WTA members voted against preserving Seles' world No. 1 ranking while she was sidelined. Since Graf skipped the Italian Open, she did not take part in the vote.<ref>{{cite news |last=Finn |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/sports/tennis-seles-struggles-with-injury-and-wta-decision.html |title=TENNIS - Seles Struggles With Injury and W.T.A.

During Seles's absence, Graf won 65 of 67 matches,<ref>{{cite news|title=Troubled WTA Tour limps through '94 season|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1994/199403/19940305/19940305007_2.html|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|date=5 March 1994|access-date=1 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202012137/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/html/cd/1994/199403/19940305/19940305007_2.html|archive-date=2 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> three of four Grand Slam events and the year-end Virginia Slims championships. She won her first French Open title since 1988 with a three-set victory over Mary Joe Fernández in the final. Fernandez had two break points to take a 3-0 and double break lead in the third set. The win elevated Graf to the World No. 1 ranking for the first time in 22 months. At Wimbledon, Graf defeated Jana Novotná to win her third consecutive, and fifth overall, ladies' title. In the third and deciding set, Novotná had a point to go up 5–1 on her serve. After breaking Novotná's serve, Graf won the next four games to take the match 7–6, 1–6, 6–4. Graf had a bone splinter in her right foot during this tournament (and for the next few months), finally resulting in surgery on 4 October.<ref>{{cite news |author=John Roberts |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis-graf-footloose-and-pain-free-germanys-world-no-1-in-intimidating-form-at-the-australian-open-1408464.html |title=Tennis: Graf footloose and pain-free: Germany's world No 1 in intimidating form at the Australian Open |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=1994-01-22 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081051/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis-graf-footloose-and-pain-free-germanys-world-no-1-in-intimidating-form-at-the-australian-open-1408464.html |archive-date=16 January 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the meantime, she lost surprisingly to [[Nicole Bradtke]] of Australia in a [[Fed Cup]] match on clay before winning the [[Acura Classic]] in San Diego and the [[Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]] in Toronto in preparation for the US Open. She won there, comfortably beating [[Helena Suková]] in the final after needing three sets to eliminate Gabriela Sabatini and [[Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere]] in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively. In the fall, Graf won the [[1993 Volkswagen Card Cup|Volkswagen Card Cup]] in Leipzig a day before her foot operation, losing only two games to Jana Novotná in the final. Graf lost to Conchita Martínez in her comeback tournament a month later in [[Advanta Championships Philadelphia|Philadelphia]]. However, she finished her year with a highlight, winning her first Virginia Slims Championships since 1989 by beating Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final despite needing painkillers for a back injury.

The 1995 Wimbledon final is regarded as one of the most dramatic women's major finals in history as Graf and Sánchez Vicario battled in a tight third set that included a 16-minute long, 13-deuce game on Sanchez Vicario's serve at 5-5.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Robin Finn|title=In a Classic, Graf Captures Wimbledon On Sheer Will|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/09/sports/tennis-in-a-classic-graf-captures-wimbledon-on-sheer-will.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 July 1995|access-date=13 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194519/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/09/sports/tennis-in-a-classic-graf-captures-wimbledon-on-sheer-will.html|archive-date=16 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In August Monica Seles made her much anticipated return to tennis at the Canadian Open.

After surviving a scare in a three-setter against Amanda Coetzer in the first round, Graf reached the final with relative ease, while Seles went through her side of the draw in even more convincing fashion. Seles and Graf met in the final, with Graf winning in three sets, saving a set point in the first set.

===Final years on the tour: 1997–99===
The last few years of Graf's career were beset by injuries, particularly to her knees and back. She lost the world No. 1 ranking to Martina Hingis and failed to win a Grand Slam title for the first time in ten years in 1997.

The pair was moderately successful, winning the [[1988 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles|1988 Wimbledon Championships]] together and reaching the finals of the French Open in 1986, 1987 and 1989. The partnership was the subject of much discussion, as the two women, both known to be shy, usually kept communication to a minimum during changeovers and between points, a highly unusual situation in doubles.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Ed|title=Sabatini, Graf: Oddest couple playing doubles|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=26 June 1988}}</ref> Sabatini said of the partnership: "doubles is all about communicating with each other, and we didn't communicate that much.

Graf also occasionally played mixed doubles, although she never won a title. She partnered with doubles specialist [[Mark Woodforde]] at the Australian Open in 1994, with [[Henri Leconte]] at Wimbledon in 1991 and at the French Open in 1994, and with [[Charlie Pasarell]] at the US Open in 1984.

[[File:Steffi Graf Farewell World Tour 2000.JPG|thumb|Steffi Graf Farewell World Tour 2000]]

==Playing style==
The main weapons in Graf's game were her powerful inside-out forehand drive (which earned her the moniker ''Fräulein Forehand'') and her intricate footwork.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742103.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wimbledon legends: Steffi Graf | date=31 May 2004 | accessdate=1 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917150936/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742103.stm | archive-date=17 September 2010 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She often positioned herself in her backhand corner and although this left her forehand wide open and vulnerable to attack, her court speed meant that only the most accurate shots wide to her forehand caused any trouble.
Graf's technique on the forehand was unique and instantly recognizable: generating considerable racquet head speed with her swing, she reached the point of contact late and typically out of the air. As a result, she hit her forehand with exceptional pace and accuracy. According to her coaches Pavel Složil and Heinz Günthardt, Graf's superior sense of timing was the key behind the success of her forehand.<ref name="youtube1"/><ref>{{cite news |author=Simon O&#039;Hagan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wimbledon-95-graf-on-a-new-curve-1588167.html |title=WIMBLEDON '95: Graf on a new curve |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811233548/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wimbledon-95-graf-on-a-new-curve-1588167.html |archive-date=11 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Graf also had a powerful backhand drive but over the course of her career tended to use it less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.<ref name="asapsports1">{{cite web |url=http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=19251 |title=ASAP Sports Transcripts - Tennis - 1995 - WTA TOUR CHAMPIONSHIPS - November 18 - Steffi Graf |website=Asapsports.com |date=1995-11-18 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313124523/http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=19251 |archive-date=13 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

She built her powerful and accurate serve up to {{convert|174|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, making it one of the fastest serves in women's tennis and was a capable volleyer.<ref name="bleacherreport1"/><ref name="grantland1"/>

An exceptionally versatile competitor, Graf remains the only player, male or female, to have won the calendar-year Grand Slam on three surfaces or to have won each Grand Slam at least four times. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion and former rival [[Chris Evert]] opined, "Steffi Graf is the best all-around player. Martina [Navratilova] won more on fast courts and I won more on slow courts, but Steffi came along and won more titles on both surfaces."<ref name="youtube1"/> Her endurance and superior footwork allowed her to excel on clay courts, where, in addition to six French Open titles, she won 26 regular tour events, including a record eight titles at the [[German Open (WTA)|German Open]]. Meanwhile, her naturally aggressive style of play, effective backhand slice and speed around the court made her even more dominant on fast surfaces such as hard courts, grass and carpet.<ref name="bleacherreport2">{{cite web |author=claudia celestial girl |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/306536-queens-of-the-court-steffi-graf |title=Queens of the Court: Steffi Graf |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128132739/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/306536-queens-of-the-court-steffi-graf |archive-date=28 January 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="grantland1"/> Graf stated that grass was her favorite surface to play on, while clay was her least favorite.<ref name="asapsports1"/>

==Equipment and endorsements==
