'''Margaret Court''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|MBE}} (née '''Smith'''; born 16 July 1942), also known as '''Margaret Smith Court''', is a retired Australian tennis player and former [[World number 1 ranked female tennis players|world No. 1]]. She won 24 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles in her career, more than any other player in history, and is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. She is currently a Christian minister in [[Perth, Western Australia]].

In 1970, Court became the first woman during the [[History of tennis#Open Era|Open Era]] (and the second woman in history after [[Maureen Connolly]]) to win the singles [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] (all four major tournaments in the same calendar year). She won 24 Grand Slam titles in total (11 in the Open era), [[All-time tennis records – women's singles#Grand Slam singles totals|which is the all-time record]]. She also won 19 women's doubles and 21 mixed doubles titles, giving her a record 64 Grand Slam titles overall. Her all surfaces (hard, clay, grass and carpet) singles career-winning percentage of 91.74 is the best of all time according to the Sporteology website.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sporteology.net/top-10-greatest-female-tennis-players-of-all-time/ |title=Top 10 Greatest Female Tennis Players Of All Time (2019 UPDATED) |author=Bill Russell |publisher=sporteology |date=11 January 2019 |accessdate=9 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911225332/https://sporteology.net/top-10-greatest-female-tennis-players-of-all-time/ |archive-date=11 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her Open era singles career winning percentage of 91.37% (593–56) is unequalled, as is her Open era winning percentage of 91.7% (11–1) in Grand Slam finals.<ref name="Elite">{{cite web | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/2325689/title/stats-corner-kim-joins-elite-club | title=Stats Corner: Kim Joins Elite Club | publisher=WTA | accessdate=8 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916025322/http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/2325689/title/stats-corner-kim-joins-elite-club | archive-date=16 September 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Her win-loss performance in all Grand Slam singles tournaments was 90.12% (210–23). She was 95.31% (61–3) at the [[Australian Open]], 90.38% (47–5) at the [[French Open]], 85.10% (51–9) at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and 89.47% (51–6) at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. She also shares the Open era record for most Grand Slam singles titles as a mother with [[Kim Clijsters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus11/news/story?id=6063992 |title=Making the case for Clijsters and Li |author=Ravi Ubha |publisher=ESPN |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://mom.me/parenting/7712-moms-who-broke-barriers/item/margaret-court/ | title=Moms who broke barriers | accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> In 1973, Court set the record for most titles won in a single Grand Slam event, with 11 Australian Open wins. This record was surpassed by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2019 when he won his [[2019 French Open – Men's Singles|12th French Open title]], but remains a women's record.

Court is one of only three players in history (all women) to have won the "[[Grand Slam (tennis)#Boxed Set|Grand Slam Boxed Set]]", consisting of every Grand Slam title (the singles, doubles and mixed doubles). Court, however, is the only one in tennis history to complete a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Multiple Career Grand Slams|Multiple Grand Slam set]], twice, in all three disciplines: singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. Uniquely, she won all 12 as an amateur and then after a period of retirement, returned as a professional to win all 12 again. Court is also one of only six tennis players ever to win a Multiple Grand Slam set in two disciplines, matching [[Roy Emerson]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Doris Hart]] and [[Serena Williams]].

The [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] states: "For sheer strength of performance and accomplishment there has never been a tennis player to match (her)."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=150 |publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame |title=Hall of Famers – Margaret Court Smith "The Arm" |accessdate=14 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119112638/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=150 |archivedate=19 November 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> In 2010, the ''Herald Sun'' newspaper of Melbourne, Australia called her the greatest female tennis player of all time, a view supported by [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/margaret-court/story-e6frf9if-1225874948364 | title=Legend Margaret Court tips Sam Stosur to win French Open | accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Margaret Court the greatest: Evonne Goolagong Cawley |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/margaret-court-the-greatest-evonne-goolagong-cawley-20170129-gu0wov.html |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 January 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

Having grown up as a [[Roman Catholic]], Court became associated with [[Pentecostalism]] in the 1970s and became a Christian minister in that tradition in 1991. She later founded Margaret Court Ministries. She has become a subject of controversy due to her views on homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

==Tennis career==
Margaret Smith was born in [[Albury]], [[New South Wales]], the youngest of four children of Lawrence Smith and Catherine Smith (née Beaufort). She has two older brothers, Kevin and Vincent, and an older sister, June Shanahan.  She is a natural left-hander who was persuaded to change to a right-hand [[Grip (tennis)|grip]]. She began playing tennis when she was eight years old and was 18 in 1960 when she won the first of seven consecutive singles titles at the [[Australian Open|Australian Championships]].

Court became the first female player from Australia to win a Grand Slam tournament abroad when she won the [[French Open|French]] and [[US Open (tennis)|US Championships]] in 1962. The year after that, she became the first Australian woman to win [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. Across singles, doubles and mixed doubles, she won a mouth-watering 64 Grand Slams.  

After Wimbledon in 1966, Court temporarily retired from tennis. She married Barry Court in 1967, whose father, [[Charles Court]], and brother, [[Richard Court]], served as [[Premier of Western Australia|premiers of Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2006/s2191991.htm |title=Moral High Ground For New Liberal President |author=Rebecca Carmody |newspaper=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=11 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712144715/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2006/s2191991.htm |archive-date=12 July 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She returned to tennis in 1968, and in 1970 won all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110460742 |title=U.S. Open Tennis – Grand Slam for Mrs. Court. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=15 September 1970 |page=22 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Roberts|editor1-first=Roberts|title=Great Australian Sporting Moments|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=dvWZHv2l7J0C&pg=PT53&lpg=PT53|date=2008|publisher=The Miegunyah Press|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=978-0522855470|page=98}}</ref> The next year, she lost the Wimbledon singles final to [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]] while pregnant<ref>{{cite news|title=Clijsters wins US Open|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/tennis/clijsters-wins-us-open/2009/09/14/1252780256848.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=14 September 2009}}</ref> with her first child, Daniel, who was born in March 1972. Court made a comeback the same year and played in the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and then played throughout 1973. Her second child, Marika, was born in 1974. She started playing again in November of that year. After missing most of 1976 after having her third child, she returned to the tour in early 1977 but retired permanently that year when she learned that she was expecting her fourth child. Her last Grand Slam tournament appearance in the singles was in the 1975 US Open.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Open|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1020000167|website=www.itftennis.com|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF)}}</ref> Her last Grand Slam tournament appearance overall was in the [[1976 Australian Open]] in the women's doubles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Open|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1020000067|website=www.itftennis.com|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF)}}</ref>

Court is one of only three players to have achieved a career "boxed set" of Grand Slam titles, winning every possible Grand Slam title – singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles – at all four Grand Slam events. The others are [[Doris Hart]] and [[Martina Navratilova]]. Court, however, is the only person to have won all 12 Grand Slam events at least twice. She also is unique in having completed a boxed set before the start of the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]] in 1968 and a separate boxed set after the start of the open era.

Court lost a heavily publicised and US–televised challenge match to a former [[World-number-one male tennis-player rankings|world No. 1]] male tennis player, the 55-year-old [[Bobby Riggs]], on 13 May 1973, in [[Ramona, California]]. Court was the top-ranked women's player at the time, and it has been reported<ref>{{Cite news | last=Roberts | first=Selena | author-link=Selena Roberts | title=Tennis's Other 'Battle of the Sexes,' Before King-Riggs | newspaper=The New York Times | date=21 August 2005 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/sports/tennis/21riggs.ready.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> that she did not take the match seriously because it was a mere exhibition. Using a mixture of [[Lob (tennis)|lobs]] and [[drop shot]]s, Riggs beat her 6–2, 6–1. Four months later, [[Billie Jean King]] beat Riggs in the [[The Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]] match in the [[Houston Astrodome]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick |first=Curry| url=https://www.si.com/vault/1973/05/21/618331/mothers-day-ms-match|work=[[Sports Illustrated]] | title=Mother's Day Ms. Match|date=21 May 1973|volume=38|issue=20|pages=35–37}}</ref>

During the 1960s, Court was considered to have a very long reach which added a new dimension to women's volleying. With a height and reach advantage and being extremely strong, she was very formidable at the net and had an effective overhead shot.<ref name="eot">{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Tennis | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofte00robe | url-access=registration | publisher=The Viking Press | author=Robertson, Max | year=1974 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofte00robe/page/174 174], 219}}</ref> She was considered unusually mobile for her size and played an all attack, serve and volley style which, when added to her big serve, dominated conservative defensive players.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6DA103BF93AA1575BC0A9679D8B63 | title=NY Times: Aces of the Game | accessdate=24 March 2012 | work=The New York Times | first=Geoff | last=Macdonald | date=29 August 2011}}</ref> Part of what helped her win was her commitment to fitness training.

Court won a record 64 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament titles, including a record 24 singles titles, 19 women's doubles titles and a record 21 mixed doubles titles. The total includes two shared<ref>{{cite web|title=Margaret (Smith) Court|url=http://www.tennis.com.au/player-profiles/margaret-smith-court|publisher=Tennis Australia|accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> titles at the [[Australian Open|Australian Championships/Open]] in 1965 and 1969.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ausopen.com/history/honour-roll/mixed-doubles |title=Official Australian Open Mixed Doubles titles.}}</ref> The mixed doubles finals of those years were not played because of bad weather and the titles are shared by both of the finalist pairs.

Court won 62 of the 85 Grand Slam tournament finals (72.9%) she played, including 24–5 (82.8%) in singles finals, 19–14 (57.6%) in women's doubles finals and 19–4 (82.6%) in mixed doubles finals.

Court reached the final in 29, the semifinals in 36 and the quarterfinals in 43 of the 47 Grand Slams singles tournaments she played. She won 11 of the 16 Grand Slam singles tournaments she entered, beginning with the 1969 Australian Open and ending with the 1973 US Open. She also won 11 of the 17 Grand Slam singles tournaments she entered, beginning with the 1962 Australian Championships and ending with the 1966 Australian Championships. She was 146–2 (98.6%) against unseeded players in Grand Slam singles tournaments.

Court is the only player to have won the Grand Slam in both singles and mixed doubles. She won the singles Grand Slam in 1970, the mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1963 with fellow Australian [[Ken Fletcher]] and the mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1965 with three different partners (Fletcher, [[John Newcombe]] and [[Fred Stolle]]).

Court won more than half of all the Grand Slam contests held in 1963 (8 of 12), 1964 (7 of 12), 1965 (9 of 12), 1969 (8 of 12), 1970 (7 of 11) and 1973 (6 of 11).

According to the end-of-year rankings compiled by London's ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1914 to 1972, Court was ranked world No. 1 six times: 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1970. She was also ranked No. 1 for 1973 when the official rankings were produced by the [[Women's Tennis Association]].

Court was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] but became involved with [[Pentecostalism]] in the mid-1970s.
