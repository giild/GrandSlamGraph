'''Justine Henin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒystin ɛnɛ̃}};<ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/henin-finds-strength-to-overcome-adversity-pkjwhx7gqs5</ref> born 1 June 1982) is a Belgian former professional [[List of female tennis players|tennis player]] known for her all-court style of play and notably being one of the few female players to use a single-handed [[backhand]]. She spent a total of 117 weeks as the [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|world No. 1]] and was the year-end No. 1 in 2003, 2006 and 2007. Henin, coming from a country with limited success in men's or women's tennis, helped establish Belgium as a leading force in women's tennis with [[Kim Clijsters]], and led the country to its first Fed Cup crown in 2001.

Henin won seven [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles: winning the [[French Open]] in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 2003 and 2007 and the [[Australian Open]] in 2004. At [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], she was the runner-up in 2001 and 2006. She also won a gold medal in the women's singles at the [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] and won the year-ending [[WTA Finals|WTA Tour Championships]] in 2006 and 2007. In total, she won 43 [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] singles titles.

Tennis experts cite her mental toughness, the completeness and variety of her game, her footspeed and footwork, and her one-handed [[backhand]] (which [[John McEnroe]] described as "the best single-handed backhand in both the women's or men's game")<ref name="BBC quotes McEnroe">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7401254.stm|title= Henin bows out at the top|work=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2008|accessdate=27 May 2008}}</ref> as the principal reasons for her success.<ref>{{cite news

When she was two, her family moved to a house in [[Rochefort, Belgium|Rochefort]], situated next to the local tennis club, where she played tennis for the first time.

== Tennis career ==
=== Early career ===
Henin, known as "Juju" to many of her fans,<ref name="espnstar.com">Han, Eugene YS  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120324210407/http://www.espnstar.com/tennis/news/detail/item176586/Sporting-Legends%3A-Justine-Henin/ Sporting Legends: Justine Henin]. Espnstar.com. Retrieved on 17 July 2016.</ref> was coached by [[Carlos Rodríguez (tennis coach)|Carlos Rodríguez]] of [[Argentina]]. In 1997, she won the junior girls' singles title at the French Open. Early in her senior career, she regularly reached the late rounds of international competitions and won five [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) tournaments by the end of 1998.

She began her professional career on the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour in May 1999 as a wild card entry in the Belgian Open clay tournament at [[Antwerp]] and became only the fifth player to win her debut WTA Tour event.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tennis Glance|date=17 May 1999|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> She also won her hometown event, the Liege Challenger, in July 2000.

Henin established herself as a major competitor in 2001, consequently reaching the women's singles semifinals of the French Open and then upset the reigning Australian Open and French Open champion [[Jennifer Capriati]] in the semifinals of [[2001 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], losing to defending champion [[Venus Williams]] in three sets in the final. By the end of the year, Henin was ranked 7th in singles, with three titles to her name. Also that year, she reached the French Open women's doubles semifinals with [[Elena Tatarkova]] and helped [[Belgium Fed Cup team|Belgium]] to win the [[2001 Fed Cup]].
Moreover, Henin played for the German tennis club Weiß-Blau [[Schweinfurt]] in 2001.<ref name="welt.de">
[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article457891/Topstar-spielt-fuer-Schweinfurt-theoretisch.html/ Topstar spielt für Schweinfurt]. 19 June 2001</ref>

In 2002, she reached four WTA finals, winning two of them, and finished the year ranked world No. 5. Her [[German Open (WTA)|German Open]] victory, her first win at a [[WTA Tier I tournaments|Tier I]] tournament, was noteworthy as she beat Jennifer Capriati in a semifinal and [[Serena Williams]] in the final, the then No. 2 and No. 5 ranked players, respectively. At Wimbledon 2002, Henin beat former world No. 1, [[Monica Seles]], in two tough sets.

=== 2003: Ascent to No. 1 ===
[[File:Justine Henin.JPG|thumb|right|Justine Henin prepares to hit a backhand|246x246px]]
Henin started the year as the 5th-ranked player in the world but lost to [[Kim Clijsters]] in the semifinals of the [[Sydney International|Medibank International]] in Sydney. In the fourth round of the Australian Open in Melbourne, she defeated [[Lindsay Davenport]] 7–5, 5–7, 9–7. In a match lasting more than three hours, Henin overcame a 4–1 final set deficit, high temperatures, and muscle cramps to defeat Davenport for the first time in her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisroundup.com/events/2003/2003_AustralianOpen/index.htm#AusDay7 |title=Australian Open review |publisher=Tennisroundup.com |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Battling BelgianJustine Henin-Hardenne |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/australian_open/2003/2673211.stm |title=Henin triumphs in thriller |work=BBC News  |date=19 January 2003 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> She then lost to Venus Williams in the semifinals in straight sets.

Henin also lost to Clijsters in the semifinals of the Proximus [[Diamond Games]] in Antwerp. At the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] one week later, she defeated Monica Seles in the final 4–6, 7–6, 7–5 after Seles had a match point at 5–4 in the second set.

Henin's next tournament was the Tier I [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Masters]]. She lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 10, [[Chanda Rubin]], 6–3, 6–2.

At the clay court [[Charleston Open|Family Circle Cup]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Henin defeated world No. 1 Serena Williams in the final. This was Williams' first loss of the year after 21 wins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9044|title=Serena Williams 2003 Results|publisher=WTA|accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref>

The following week, Henin reached the semifinals of the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]] in [[Amelia Island]], Florida, losing to eventual winner [[Elena Dementieva]] 3–6, 6–4, 7–5. Henin then helped Belgium defeat Austria 5–0 in a first round tie of the Fed Cup.

In May, Henin successfully defended her title at the [[German Open (WTA)|German Open]] in Berlin. In the final, she saved three match points in the third set before defeating Clijsters.

At the French Open, she was the fourth seeded player and defeated the defending champion, Serena Williams, in a controversial semifinal 6–2, 4–6, 7–5 which saw Henin asked to acknowledge her raised hand during a Williams service motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2003/french_open/news/2003/06/06/henin_williams_rt/|title=She Said, She Said: Serena cries foul, but Henin-Hardenne offers no apology |date=6 June 2003|accessdate=23 May 2013|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref><ref>[http://gregcouch.com/2011/02/25/serena-henin-still-searching-for-closure-on-hand-incident/ Serena, Henin Still Searching for Closure on Hand Incident | Greg Couch on Tennis].

This was her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] title, and she was the first Belgian ever to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Henin then began her preparations for Wimbledon. At the grass court [[Ordina Open]] in [[Rosmalen]], she lost in the final to Clijsters; she was forced to retire from the match after injuring her finger. At [[2003 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Henin was the third seeded player. She defeated [[Mary Pierce]] in the fourth round and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the quarterfinals before losing to Serena Williams in straight sets.

Henin's first competition after Wimbledon was the Fed Cup tie against [[Slovakia]]. She won both her singles matches to help Belgium win the tie 5–0 and begin her 22-match winning streak. She then played two tournaments during the North American summer hard court season before the [[2003 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. At the Tier I [[Acura Classic]] in San Diego, the third-seeded Henin defeated the top-seeded Clijsters in the final. Two weeks later at the Tier I [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] in Toronto, she defeated Russia's [[Lina Krasnoroutskaya]] in the final.

Henin was the second-seeded player at the US Open. She won her first four matches against unseeded players before defeating seventh-seeded [[Anastasia Myskina]] in the quarterfinals and then defeated sixth-seeded Jennifer Capriati in the semifinals 4–6, 7–5, 7–6<sup>(4)</sup> in a match that lasted more than three hours and stretched to midnight. Henin recovered from a 3–5 deficit in the second set and a 2–5 deficit in the final set and was just two points from defeat eleven times. She was treated for muscle cramps and dehydration overnight but returned to play in the final the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/open/2003-09-05-womens-semis_x.htm |title=Henin-Hardenne tops Capriati in classic to face Clijsters in final |work=USA Today  |date=6 September 2003 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> In the final, Henin defeated Clijsters in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2003/sep/07usopen.htm |title=Henin-Hardenne lifts US Open title |publisher=Rediff.com |date=September 2003}}</ref> The win raised Henin's ranking to world No. 2, just behind Clijsters.

At her next event, the indoor [[Sparkassen Cup (tennis)|Sparkassen Cup]] in Leipzig, she lost to Myskina in the final. This ended Henin's 22-match winning streak. Two weeks later at the indoor [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in [[Filderstadt]], Henin lost in the final to Clijsters. Had she won this match, she would have immediately replaced Clijsters as the world No. 1.

At the Tier I [[Zurich Open]] the following week, Henin reached her sixth consecutive final where she defeated Serbia's [[Jelena Dokić]]. This win catapulted her to become the 13th world No. 1 on the WTA computer rankings on 20 October, 2003. Henin temporarily lost her number 1 ranking after a week as she declined to defend her title at the [[Linz Open|Generali Ladies Linz]] tournament.

At the season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]] in Los Angeles, Henin defeated Myskina and Capriati and lost to Japan's [[Ai Sugiyama]] in her round robin matches, which was sufficient to advance and return to the top spot on the WTA ranking. In the semifinals, she lost to [[Amélie Mauresmo]] 6–7<sup>(2)</sup>, 6–3, 3–6, but managed to close a season ranked world No. 1 for the first time.

Henin was named the ITF's women's singles World Champion for 2003.

=== 2004: Australian Open and Olympic gold ===
Henin started 2004 by winning a warm-up tournament in Sydney and then the Australian Open in Melbourne, defeating Clijsters in three sets in the final.
By the end of 2004's spring hard court season, Henin had built a 25-match Tier I win streak and 22–1 win-loss record, winning her first 16 matches.

At the start of the spring clay court season, Henin's health was adversely affected by infection with a strain of [[cytomegalovirus]] and an immune system problem. She often slept up to 18 hours a day but barely had the strength to brush her teeth, let alone play competitive tennis.

Although Henin decided to defend her French Open title and was seeded first in the tournament, she lost her second round match to a much lower-ranked player, [[Tathiana Garbin]] of Italy. At the time, the loss marked only the second time in 15 Grand Slam events that she had lost before the fourth round.

After months of layoff because of a virus, Henin returned to competition in August and won the women's singles [[gold medal]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Athens, defeating [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the final 6–3, 6–3. Henin reached the gold medal match by defeating reigning French Open champion [[Anastasia Myskina]] in a semifinal 7–5, 5–7, 8–6 after having trailed 1–5 in the final set.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-08-21/molik-falls-as-henin-sets-gold-standard/2029830 Molik falls as Henin sets gold standard]. abc.net.au. 21 August 2004</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/tennis/3583968.stm |title=Henin-Hardenne into final |work=BBC News  |date=20 August 2004 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> Her medal ceremony was attended by fellow countryman and IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]].

In September, she was unsuccessful in her defence of her [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title, losing to [[Nadia Petrova]] in the fourth round. This defeat caused her to lose the world No. 1 ranking, which she had held for 45 non-consecutive weeks. She then withdrew from the ten remaining tournaments of the year in an effort to recover her health and improve her fitness.

=== 2005: Second French Open and injuries ===
[[File:JUSTINE HENIN (2714310623).jpg|thumb|222x222px|Justine Henin in 2005]]
Her plan to rejoin the tour at the beginning of 2005 was delayed when she fractured her [[kneecap]] in a December 2004 training session.

On 25 March, after more than six months away from competition, Henin returned to the WTA tour at the [[Miami Masters]]. She lost to second ranked [[Maria Sharapova]] in a quarterfinal. She rebounded at her next tournament, winning the clay court Family Circle Cup in Charleston. She won two more clay court titles before the start of the [[2005 French Open|French Open]]. Her victories over top-ranked Lindsay Davenport, Sharapova, Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Petrova made her a top contender for the title there.

Henin was seeded tenth at the French Open and defeated the French player [[Mary Pierce]] in the final in straight sets to take her second title at Roland Garros. The win marked Henin's 24th consecutive clay court win and her tenth consecutive final win, a streak dating back to Zurich in October 2003. In capturing the title, she defeated Kuznetsova in the fourth round, Sharapova in a quarterfinal, and Petrova in a semifinal. Henin saved two match points to defeat Kuznetsova in the fourth round 7–6<sup>(6)</sup>, 4–6, 7–5 and thus became only the second woman to win the French Open after saving a match point.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/tennis/4592641.stm |title=Brave Henin-Hardenne battles on |work=BBC News  |date=30 May 2005 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>

With her French Open victory, Henin moved from world No. 12 to No. 7 in the women's singles rankings. She was a perfect 24–0 on clay this year and joined Monica Seles as the only two currently active (in 2005) players on the WTA Tour to have won the French Open at least twice.

At [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], her win streak of 24 matches was snapped in the first round by Greek [[Eleni Daniilidou]] 7–6, 2–6, 7–5. It was the first time that a reigning French Open champion failed to win a match at Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holt |first=Sarah |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4116834.stm |title=Henin-Hardenne makes shock exit |work=BBC News  |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/22/SPG0ODC8LH1.DTL |title=Wimbledon Notebook: Eleni Daniilidou's win of a lifetime |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=22 June 2005 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> A [[hamstring]] injury sustained earlier in the year eventually limited her to playing only 11 more matches for 2005.

Henin next played the [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] in Toronto, where she reached the final after beating Mauresmo in a semifinal before losing to Clijsters in straight sets. She lost in the fourth round of the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] to eventual finalist Mary Pierce 3–6, 4–6. Following this, she played in Filderstadt, but after losing her first round match to [[Flavia Pennetta]], she decided not to play for the rest of 2005.

[[TENNIS Magazine]] placed her in 31st place on its list of that year of the 40 Greatest Players for the period 1965 through 2005.

In November, at the [[2005 WTA Tour Championships|Tour Championships]], she was named the inaugural winner of the Whirlpool 6th Sense Player of the Year, which honors the player who has demonstrated the most sixth sense intuition, that is to say "heightened intelligence, unbeatable performance and pinpoint precision".

[[File:Justine henin hardenne medibank international 2006 02.jpg|thumb|Justine Henin at the 2006 Medibank International in Sydney|alt=|left|222x222px]]
In January, Henin returned to competitive tennis at the [[N.S.W Open/Medibank International|tournament in Sydney]], a tune-up for the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. She was seeded fifth and played former world No. 1 (and newly returned to competitive tennis) [[Martina Hingis]] in a much hyped first round match. Henin won 6–3, 6–3.

At the Australian Open, Henin defeated top-ranked Lindsay Davenport and fourth ranked Maria Sharapova in three-set matches to set up a final against third ranked Amélie Mauresmo. While trailing 6–1, 2–0, Henin retired from the match, citing intense stomach pain caused by over-use of anti-inflammatories for a persistent shoulder injury. Henin stated afterwards that she feared possible injury had she continued to play. Henin was criticized by the press<ref>{{cite news | last = Collins | first = Bud | title = Henin-Hardenne took the queasy way out |work=The Boston Globe | date = 29 January 2006 | url = http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/tennis/articles/2006/01/29/henin_hardenne_took_the_queasy_way_out/ | accessdate =11 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Shriver, Pam | title = Shriver: Henin-Hardenne's reputation is tarnished | publisher=[[ESPN]]| date = 29 September 2006 | url = http://proxy.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus06/columns/story?id=2310543 | accessdate =11 February 2008 | authorlink = Pam Shriver }}</ref> because she had stated after her semifinal win against Sharapova that she was at the "peak of her fitness" and was playing the "best tennis of her life".

Henin captured her second title of the year at zhe Tier II event in Dubai defeating Sharapova 7–5, 6–2. This was her third Dubai title, having won previously in 2003 and 2004. At Tier I [[Pacific Life Open]] in Indian Wells, Henin lost in the semifinals to fourth-seeded Elena Dementieva 6–2, 5–7, 5–7, after leading 6–2, 5–2 and serving for the match twice. Henin also lost in the second round of Tier I Miami Masters to [[Meghann Shaughnessy]] 5–7, 4–6.

On [[clay court|clay]], she failed to retain her title at the Family Circle Cup, losing in the semifinals to third-seeded [[Patty Schnyder]] 6–2, 3–6, 2–6. It was her first career defeat at this tournament and the end of her 27-match winning streak on clay. Henin then helped Belgium defeat defending champion Russia in a [[2006 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]] quarterfinal. She beat fifth ranked Nadia Petrova 6–7, 6–4, 6–3, and 9th ranked Elena Dementieva 6–2, 6–0. Petrova had come into the tie with two consecutive clay court tournament victories and a ten-match clay court winning streak, while Dementieva had defeated Henin in their last meeting in Indian Wells and defeated second ranked Belgian compatriot Kim Clijsters on the first day of the tie. Three weeks later, Henin played the Tier I [[German Open (WTA)|Qatar Telecom German Open]], defeating Mauresmo in the semifinal 6–1, 6–2 before losing to Petrova in a three-set final.

At the French Open, Henin defeated second seeded Clijsters in the semifinals 6–3, 6–2. She then defeated Kuznetsova in the final to win her third French Open singles title in four years.

At the [[International Women's Open|Eastbourne]] grass court tournament just before Wimbledon, Henin defeated Anastasia Myskina in the final in three sets.

Henin was the third seed going into Wimbledon and advanced to her third consecutive Grand Slam final without losing a set. She defeated Clijsters (who was seeded second) in a semifinal 6–4, 7–6<sup>(4)</sup> but lost the final to Mauresmo. The final featured two finesse players who used their all-court games, a break from recent years that featured a succession of power baseliners claiming the title. At almost every point throughout the match, both players approached the net to volley. Tipped as the tournament favorite, Henin won the first set. But Mauresmo recovered to win the next two sets and her second Grand Slam singles title and deny the Belgian a career Grand Slam.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cheese |first=Caroline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/5161122.stm |title=Mauresmo clinches Wimbledon title |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/sports/amelie-mauresmo-the-sentimental-favorite-to-win/35575/ |title=Amelie Mauresmo the Sentimental Favorite to Win Wimbledon |publisher=Nysun.com |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> This was the only Wimbledon final of the decade that did not involve Venus and/or Serena Williams.

Henin withdrew from Tier I events in San Diego and [[Canada Masters|Montreal]] because of injury but played the tournament in [[Pilot Pen Tennis|New Haven]]. There, she defeated Kuznetsova and Davenport en route to the title. It was her 28th WTA tour title. She returned to the world No. 2 ranking and crossed over US$12&nbsp;million in career prize money.

At the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Maria Sharapova defeated Henin in the final after Henin had defeated Lindsey Davenport in the quarterfinals and [[Jelena Janković]] in the semifinals. Henin became the first woman since Hingis in 1997 to reach the finals of all four Grand Slam singles tournaments in a calendar year.

Henin won both of her singles matches during the Fed Cup final against Italy in [[Charleroi]]. However, Henin retired from the deciding doubles match because of a knee injury while she and her partner [[Kirsten Flipkens]] were trailing 3–6, 6–2, 2–0, giving Italy the championship.

Henin guaranteed her year-end world No. 1 ranking by reaching the final of the [[WTA Finals|Sony Ericsson Championships]], defeating Maria Sharapova in the semifinals 6–2, 7–6<sup>(5)</sup>. Henin then defeated Mauresmo and won the tournament for the first time in her career.

Henin was the first player since Hingis in 2000 to win the WTA Tour Championships and end the year as the top-ranked player.

On 4 January 2007, Henin withdrew from the Australian Open and the warm-up [[Sydney International|tournament in Sydney]] to deal with the break-up of her marriage. Not playing those tournaments caused Henin to lose the world No. 1 ranking to Maria Sharapova.

She then defeated Janković in the semifinals 6–2, 6–2. In the final, Henin defeated [[Ana Ivanovic]] in straight sets, 6–1, 6–2 to claim her third consecutive French Open title, equalling Seles's [[History of tennis|open era]] record.

Williams then broke Henin to pull within 5–4 but Henin broke Williams again in the last game to win the match 7–6<sup>(2)</sup>, 6–4.

This victory extended Henin's winning streak to 25 matches. She only lost three sets after Wimbledon. This victory made her the sixth player to successfully defend her title at the WTA's season-ending championship and the first player to claim at least ten tour titles in a year since Hingis won twelve in 1997. She also became the first woman to break the US$5&nbsp;million barrier in prize money in a year, and by crossing US$19&nbsp;million, Henin is now ranked fifth on the all time prize money list.

Henin ended the year ranked world No. 1 for the third time in her career, having done so previously in 2003 and 2006.

She also ended the year with a 63–4 record, having lost to only four players: Lucie Šafářová, Serena Williams, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Marion Bartoli.

=== 2008: Retirement ===
Henin started the year as the world No. 1. 14 January marked Henin's 100th career week as world No. 1, and on 10 March, Henin became only the seventh female player to be ranked world No. 1 for 12 consecutive months.

Henin announced her immediate retirement from professional tennis on 14 May 2008, and requested the WTA to remove her name from the rankings immediately.

In the first round, Henin saw off German qualifier [[Julia Görges]] 7–6<sup>(3)</sup>, 6–1. In her second round, she defeated world No. 12 and fellow Belgian Yanina Wickmayer, defeating her for the 2nd consecutive time, 6–3, 7–5. In the quarterfinals, she defeated fourth seed and world No. 7 Jelena Janković 3–6, 7–6<sup>(4)</sup>, 6–3 for the tenth time in her career. She defeated world No. 20 [[Shahar Pe'er]] in the semifinals, 6–3, 6–2, and reached her third final in five tournaments this year. She faced world No. 10 Samantha Stosur. Henin won the final 6–4, 2–6, 6–1 in 100&nbsp;minutes, to procure her first title in 2010 (in her 3rd final). Winning this tournament also sent Henin into the top 20 for the first time since her comeback.

At the [[2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open|Madrid Open]] she was defeated in the first round by eventual champion [[Aravane Rezaï]] 4–6, 7–5, 6–0. As a result of this loss, Henin dropped out of the top 20 to No. 23. Henin then participated at the [[2010 French Open|French Open]], seeded 22nd, the second grand slam of the year where she had won four previous titles. In the 1st round, she defeated [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] in 89&nbsp;minutes, 6–4, 6–3. In the second round, Henin faced [[Klára Koukalová|Klára Zakopalová]] and defeated her 6–3, 6–3. In the third round, facing former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova, Henin ended her streak of consecutive sets at 40, losing the 2nd set to Sharapova but going on to win 6–2, 3–6, 6–3. She had then tied the number of consecutive sets won at the French Open with [[Helen Wills|Helen Wills Moody]]. She lost to world No. 7 Samantha Stosur 6–2, 1–6, 4–6 in the fourth round, her first defeat at Roland Garros since 2004.[[File:Justine Henin Photos by Sascha Grabow.jpg|thumb|Justine Henin winning the 2010 Stuttgart Porsche Cup|222x222px]]

Henin began the grass court season at the [[2010 UNICEF Open|UNICEF Open]], where she was the top seed for the first time since her return. In the first three rounds she defeated [[Angelique Kerber]], [[Roberta Vinci]], and [[Kristina Barrois]] in straight sets. She then beat No. 5 seed [[Alexandra Dulgheru]] in the semifinals, 6–2, 6–2. In the final, she defeated No. 7 seed [[Andrea Petkovic]] to win her 43rd career title and second of the year.

At the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon Championships]], Henin was the No. 17 seed. In the third round, she had a victory over Nadia Petrova, winning 6–1, 6–4. She was eventually defeated in the fourth round by Kim Clijsters 2–6, 6–2, 6–3, after convincingly winning the first set. Midway through the first set, Henin slipped on the court, injuring her right elbow. Further examinations revealed a partial ligament fracture in her elbow, causing her to end her 2010 season prematurely.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/01/justine-henin-wimbledon|title=Wimbledon 2010: Injured Justine Henin out of US Open|last=Cambers|first=Simon|date=1 July 2010|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> She was awarded the [[WTA Awards#Comeback Player of the Year|WTA Comeback Player of the Year]] award in December for her 2010 season.<ref name="Comeback2010" />

===2011: Second retirement===
Henin started her season at the [[2011 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]]. She did not lose any sets in the competition earning comfortable victories over [[Alicia Molik]] from Australia, [[Sesil Karatantcheva]] from [[Kazakhstan]], Ana Ivanovic of [[Serbia]] and [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]] of the US in the final.

Henin was the 11th seed and a defending finalist at the [[2011 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. Henin defeated [[Sania Mirza]] from India in the first round 5–7, 6–3, 6–1 and [[Elena Baltacha]] in the second, 6–1, 6–3. She then fell to 23rd seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, 4–6, 6–7<sup>(8)</sup>.

On 26 January 2011, Henin announced her definitive retirement from professional tennis, due to an exacerbation of the elbow injury she sustained the previous year at Wimbledon.<ref name='2011_ret' />

== Playing style ==
At the [[2007 French Open]], [[Martina Navratilova]] said that "Henin's offense is just phenomenal ... it's sort of like we've got 'the female [[Roger Federer|Federer]]', or maybe the guys have 'the male Justine Henin', because she is just head and shoulders above everyone else right now."<ref name="nyt2010"/><ref>Interview with Barbara Schett, [[Eurosport]], 7 June 2007</ref> Her footwork, balance, and court coverage—and she is adept at changing from a defensive style to an aggressive one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbaneinternational.com.au/2009/10/will-justine-come-to-brisbane|title=Henin coming to Brisbane|publisher=brisbaneinternational.com.au|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref>
Compared to the rest of her game, Henin's serve was rather inconsistent.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/322308-clijsters-vs-henin-final-at-brisbane-rivalry-reignited Kim Clijsters vs. Justine Henin Final at Brisbane: Rivalry Reignited].

She could hit her backhand flat, with heavy topspin, or slice [underspin]. Her backhand could also be used to surprise her opponents with drop shots, breaking up the pattern of a groundstroke rally. Her [[forehand]] was generally regarded as her most dangerous weapon,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and the stroke that she normally used to dictate play in a match. It was underrated as most only spoke of her backhand, but particularly in her dominant years of 2003 and 2007, she would dominate the tone of matches with her huge and versatile forehand. Like her serve, her forehand was something retooled during her career and took inspiration from [[Andre Agassi]]'s forehand.<ref name="nysun1"/>

A notable aspect of Henin's playing style was the completeness of her game—the variety and versatility she had. Her style was often compared to that of Roger Federer and to five-time Grand Slam winner [[Martina Hingis]] as well. Four-time Grand Slam winner Kim Clijsters commented "Growing up together, she's always been the more touchy player. She has good hands ... she has those quick hands."<ref>[http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Belgian-Blockbuster--Kim-Clijsters-Vs--Justine-Hen.aspx Belgian Blockbuster: Kim Clijsters Vs.

Smh.com.au.</ref>

=== One-handed (topspin) backhand ===
In an era where two-handed backhands have become increasingly more popular due to their greater power and control, albeit at the expense of reach and shot variety, Henin possessed one of the best one-handed backhands to have ever played the sport of tennis.  Her one-handed topspin backhand was particularly celebrated because it contained both unmatched power as well as accuracy, two factors that many juniors may find challenging to acquire earlier in their development and thus have driven a good number of them, especially girls, to choose playing two-handed backhands. Additionally, with Henin's one-handed backhand, it had also enabled her to play not only with more reach but also more variety in her shots (e.g. slices instead of topspin etc) as the situation required. [[John McEnroe]] has called Henin's backhand "the best in men's or women's tennis."<ref>{{Citation|last=davetennisx|title=[HL] Justine Henin vs. Jennifer Capriati 2003 US Open [SF] [2/2]|date=2010-09-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krUzMVKMl6M|accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref>

=== Volleying ability ===
Henin had always been considered one of the better volleyers on tour, but soon established herself as one of the best in the modern era.
Two-time US Open Champion [[Tracy Austin]] commented, "At the net she's quite comfortable displaying excellent technique. She knows where to position herself—a contrast to many other players who get up to the net and look like a deer in headlights."<ref>[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/22610659/ns/sports-tennis/ NBC Sports | News, Video, Now]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Nbcsports.msnbc.com. Retrieved on 17 July 2016.</ref>
Renowned tennis coach [[Nick Bollettieri]] included Henin as one of the few female tennis players he regarded as being a successful volleyer and an adept serve-and-volleyer, alongside the likes of [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Jana Novotná]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midatlantic.usta.com/will_the_serve_and_volley_ever_bounce_back// |title=Will the Serve & Volley ever bounce back? |author=Bollettieri, Nick |work=midatlantic.usta.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603062238/http://www.midatlantic.usta.com/will_the_serve_and_volley_ever_bounce_back// |archivedate= 3 June 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://classic.tennisrecruiting.net/article.asp?id=591/ The Tennis Recruiting Network].

After retiring, Henin became involved in two Belgian reality shows in 2009. In May, she starred in ''De Twaalf Werken van Justine Henin'' – ''Les 12 travaux de Justine Henin'' (''The 12 Labours of Justine Henin''). The show followed Henin as she completed 12 personal challenges. In June 2009, she hosted a musical TV show that revolved around Belgian-Italian singer [[Lara Fabian]].<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/11/SPORT/article/detail/222381/2009/03/19/Justine-Henin-begint-carriere-als-tv-ster.dhtml Justine Henin begint carrière als tv-ster] [[Het Parool]], 19 March 2009</ref>
