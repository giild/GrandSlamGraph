'''Maureen Catherine Connolly-Brinker''' (''née'' '''Connolly'''; September 17, 1934 – June 21, 1969), known as "'''Little Mo'''", was an American [[tennis]] player, the winner of nine [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles in the early 1950s. In 1953, she became the first woman to win all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments during the same calendar year. The following year, in July 1954, a [[Equestrianism|horseback riding]] accident seriously injured her right leg and ended her competitive tennis career at age 19.

==Early years==
Maureen was born in [[San Diego]], [[California]] on September 17, 1934, the first child of Martin and Jessamine Connolly.<ref name=josdh>{{cite journal|title=San Diego's Sweetheart: Maureen Connolly|journal=The Journal of San Diego History|volume=54|issue=2|date=Spring 2008|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v54-2/pdf/v54-2seymour.pdf|author=Joey Seymour}}</ref> Her parents divorced when she was three years old and she was raised by her mother and an aunt.<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Billie Jean|title=We Have Come a Long Way : The Story of Women's Tennis|date=1988|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0070346253|page=[https://archive.org/details/wehavecomelongwa00king/page/83 83]|author2=Starr, Cynthia|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/wehavecomelongwa00king/page/83}}</ref> She loved horseback riding as a child, but her mother was unable to pay the cost of riding lessons. So, she took up the game of tennis. Connolly's tennis career began at the age of 10 on the municipal courts of San Diego. Her first coach, Wilbur Folsom, encouraged her to switch from a left-handed grip to right<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|title=Heroes and villains: Maureen Connolly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/05/tennis.features|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 5, 2005}}</ref> and she soon became a baseline specialist with tremendous power and accuracy, and a strong backhand. When she was 11, Maureen was dubbed "Little Mo" by San Diego sportswriter Nelson Fisher, who compared the power of her forehand and backhand to the firepower of the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']], known colloquially as "Big Mo".<ref name=josdh/><ref name=bbc/> In 1948, Folsom was replaced as her coach by [[Eleanor Tennant]], who previously coached [[Alice Marble]] and [[Bobby Riggs]], both Wimbledon and U.S. singles champions.<ref name=josdh/> At age 14, she won 56 consecutive matches, and the following year became the youngest ever to win the U.S. national championship for girls 18 and under.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

==Playing career==
At the 1951 [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], the 16-year-old Connolly defeated [[Shirley Fry]] to become, at that time, the youngest ever to win America's most prestigious tennis tournament.<ref name=mcwatcr/><ref name=mcyncih>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qEgbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iU0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4155%2C1895709|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press]] |agency=United Press |title=Maureen Connolly youngest net champ in history |date=September 6, 1951 |page=49 |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> Her coach at the time was Eleanor Tennant.<ref name=mcptbrtp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZTNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kAgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3924%2C1186134 |newspaper=News and Courier |location=[[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, SC]] |last=Snider |first=Steve |agency=United Press |title=Maureen Connolly planning to be 'real tennis player'|date=September 7, 1951 |page=2B |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref>

Connolly won her first [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]] title in 1952, defeating [[Louise Brough]] in the final. She had arrived at the tournament with a shoulder injury but refused to withdraw when Tennant instructed her to do so. The ensuing argument resulted in the end of their partnership.<ref name="guardian"/> Connolly was seeded first at the 1952 U.S. Championships and successfully defended her title with a victory in the final against [[Doris Hart]].<ref name=mcnfaoty>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ss8AAAAIBAJ&sjid=7i0MAAAAIBAJ&pg=4425%2C2332720

Connolly won the last nine Grand Slam singles tournaments she played, including 50 consecutive singles matches. During her [[Wightman Cup]] career from 1951 through 1954, she won all seven of her singles matches. Connolly's achievements made her the darling of the media and one of the most popular personalities in the U.S.; she was named [[Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year|Female Athlete of the Year]] by the [[Associated Press]] for three straight years, from 1951 through 1953.<ref name=lmntfa3t>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y1hOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fQAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6024%2C2734759 |newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]] |agency=Associated Press |title=Little Mo named top female athlete 3rd time|date=January 8, 1954 |page=30 |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> 
In 1954, Connolly did not defend her title at the Australian Championships, but successfully defended her French and Wimbledon championships.

==Later life==
===Horseriding accident===
Two weeks after she won her third-straight Wimbledon title, she was horseback riding in San Diego on July 20. A passing concrete mixer truck frightened her horse Colonel Merryboy, which pinned Connolly between the horse and truck. She was thrown and suffered a compound fracture to her right [[fibula]], which ultimately ended her tennis career at age 19.<ref name=tgmcditx>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UjpWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cOkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7361%2C2352229|newspaper=Spokesman-Review|agency=Associated Press|title=Tennis great Mo Connolly dies in Texas|date=June 22, 1969|page=4–sports}}</ref> She had intended to turn professional after the 1954 U.S. National Championships.<ref name="connollycase">''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8408166016021329600 Connolly v.

In June 1955, Connolly married [[Norman E.
