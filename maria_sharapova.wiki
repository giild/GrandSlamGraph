Her parents, Yuri Sharapov and Yelena, are from [[Gomel]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]. Concerned about the regional effects of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear accident]], they left their homeland shortly before Maria was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wtatour/2309886/Sharapova-still-haunted-by-Chernobyl.html|title=Sharapova still haunted by Chernobyl|publisher=The Telegraph|date=March 27, 2007|accessdate=February 26, 2020|author=Mark Hodgkinson}}</ref><ref name="ITH_2007_08_13">{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14164248/|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|script-title=ru:Шарапова, Мария|trans-title=Sharapova, Maria|language=Russian|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Introduction to tennis===
In 1989, when Sharapova was three, the family moved to [[Sochi]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], Russia. She hit her first tennis ball when she was 4 years old. Her father, Yuri, befriended Aleksandr Kafelnikov, whose son [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov|Yevgeny]] would go on to win two Grand Slam singles titles and become Russia's first world No. 1 ranked tennis player. Aleksandr gave Sharapova her first tennis racquet in 1991 when she was four, whereupon she began practicing regularly with her father at a local park.<ref name="times">{{cite news|author=Paul Kimmage|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article3177376.ece|title=The Big Interview: Maria Sharapova|work=[[The Times]]|date=January 13, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2008|location=London}}</ref> Maria took her first tennis lessons with veteran Russian coach Yuri Yutkin, who was instantly impressed when he saw her play, noting her "exceptional [[hand-eye coordination]]".<ref name="Article">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11732071-masha-was-a-star-at-four.do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707185603/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11732071-masha-was-a-star-at-four.do |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |author=Will Stewart |work=London Evening Standard |location=UK |title='Masha' was a star at four |date=July 2, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2010 |df= }}</ref>

===Start of professional training===
In 1993, at the age of six, Sharapova attended a tennis clinic in Moscow run by [[Martina Navratilova]], who recommended professional training with [[Nick Bollettieri]] at the [[IMG Academy]] in [[Bradenton, Florida]], who had previously trained players such as [[Andre Agassi]], [[Monica Seles]], and [[Anna Kournikova]].<ref name="times"/> With money tight, Yuri Sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States, which they finally did in 1994.<ref name="Article" /> Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years.<ref name="ITH_2007_08_13"/> Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700,<ref name="Article" /> Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. Initially, she trained with Rick Macci. In 1995, however, she was signed by [[IMG (business)|IMG]], who agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for Sharapova to stay at the Academy, allowing her to finally enroll at the age of 9.<ref name="times"/>

===2015: Fourth Australian Open final===
{{main|2015 Maria Sharapova tennis season}}
Sharapova kicked off her 2015 season at the Brisbane International where she was top seed and received a bye in the first round. Sharapova defeated Yaroslava Shvedova and Carla Suárez Navarro. In the semi finals, Sharapova faced Elina Svitolina, beating her in straight sets. Reaching the final without dropping a set, Sharapova played an intense match against second seed Ana Ivanovic but came through in three sets. This was Sharapova's 10th win over Ivanovic and by winning her 34th title, it meant that Sharapova had won at least one title every year for 13 consecutive years. Also, it was just her second title in Australia so far, and for both she beat Ivanovic. Sharapova's next tournament was the 2015 Australian Open, where she beat [[Petra Martić]] and fellow countrywoman [[Alexandra Panova]] (despite having two match points against her) in the first two rounds, before beating [[Zarina Diyas]] and [[Peng Shuai]] in straight sets. There, she beat seventh-seeded [[Eugenie Bouchard]] and fellow Russian [[Ekaterina Makarova]] in straight sets to make her fourth Australian Open final, where she lost to [[Serena Williams]] in straight sets, worsening her record against her to 2–17. In February, following her participation in the [[2015 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]], Sharapova played in [[2015 Abierto Mexicano Telcel|Acapulco]], where she beat [[Shelby Rogers]], [[Mariana Duque Mariño]] and [[Magdaléna Rybáriková]] to advance the semifinals. Sharapova later withdrew from her match against [[Caroline Garcia]], citing a stomach virus. Next, in [[2015 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], she beat [[Yanina Wickmayer]] and [[Victoria Azarenka]] in straight sets, before losing to defending champion [[Flavia Pennetta]] in the fourth round in three sets. After receiving a bye in the first round of the [[2015 Miami Open|Miami Open]], Sharapova lost in the second round to fellow Russian [[Daria Gavrilova]] in straight sets, marking her earliest exit from the tournament since her first appearance in Miami in 2003.

Sharapova began her clay season in [[2015 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]] where she was the three-time defending champion. After receiving a first-round bye, she lost in the second round to [[Angelique Kerber]] in three sets, snapping Sharapova's win streak at the tournament and marking her first-ever loss at the tournament, having won it three times in a row ([[2012 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|2012]], [[2013 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|2013]], & [[2014 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|2014]]). The loss also snapped a 64 match win streak on clay where Sharapova won the first set and went on to win the match. The last time Sharapova lost a match on clay after winning the first set was against [[Dinara Safina]] in the fourth round at the [[2008 French Open]]. As a result of the loss Sharapova lost the No. 2 ranking to [[Simona Halep]]. Sharapova's next clay court tournament was the Madrid Open where she was the defending champion. She advanced to the semifinals. There, she was beaten by Svetlana Kuznetsova for the first time since 2008. Sharapova's next tournament was the Italian Open in Rome where she was seeded 3rd. She beat [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the quarterfinals in straight sets to set up a re-match with [[Daria Gavrilova]]. She beat Gavrilova in straight sets to advance to the final, where she faced [[Carla Suárez Navarro]]. After losing the first set, Sharapova managed to claim the next two sets and her third [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]]  title. By winning Rome, Sharapova reclaimed the No. 2 ranking over Halep, until August 24, when Halep went again to world No. 2, due to Sharapova's not playing any match after [[2015 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] (where she reached the semifinals but lost to Serena), including US Open, due to injuries.

She then received a wildcard into [[2015 Wuhan Open|Wuhan Open]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Maria Sharapova To Come Back In Wuhan|url = http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5016773/title/maria-sharapova-to-come-back-in-wuhan|website = Women's Tennis Association|accessdate = January 5, 2016}}</ref> and received a bye into the 2nd round.

Sharapova then played the player who finished 2nd in the White Group, [[Petra Kvitová]]. She lost the match in straight sets, despite having a 5–1 lead in the second set.

Sharapova then played in the [[2015 Fed Cup World Group|Fed Cup final]], winning both of her matches, against [[Karolína Plíšková]] and got revenge against [[Petra Kvitová]] for her loss in the WTA Finals. However, [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russia]] eventually lost 2–3 after falling in a crucial doubles rubber. The Russian ended the season as being the world No. 4, despite not playing the US Open Series and missing most of the Fall Asian Hardcourt season. She had a win-loss record of 39–9 and won 2 titles, reaching the second week in all of the Grand Slams she played.

This marked her third consecutive first-round loss at a Grand Slam tournament and, following the tournament, her ranking fell to no. 369, her lowest ranking since August 2002.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/australian-open-2020-maria-sharapova-vs-donna-vekic-result-return-a9293766.html|title =Maria Sharapova unsure if she will return to Australian Open after first-round defeat by Donna Vekic|date=21 January 2020|work=The Independent|accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref>	

That defeat to Vekic in Melbourne would prove to be Sharapova's final match of her career, as on 26 February 2020, Sharapova announced her retirement from tennis. In an essay in [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], Sharapova wrote: "I'm new to this, so please forgive me. Tennis – I'm saying goodbye. But as I embark on my next chapter, I want anyone who dreams of excelling in anything to know that doubt and judgement are inevitable. You will fail hundreds of times and the world will watch you.

Following a hearing on 7 and 8 September 2016, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) panel found that Sharapova had a reduced perception of the risk that she took while using Mildronate, because (a) she had used Mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she had consulted the Russian doctor who prescribed the Mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (c) she had received no specific warning about the change in status of meldonium from WADA, the ITF, or the WTA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/243891/243891.pdf|title=CAS 2016/A/4643 Maria Sharapova v.

==Fed Cup participation==
Sharapova has lived in the United States since moving there at the age of seven, but retains her Russian citizenship, and is therefore eligible to play in the [[Fed Cup]] for Russia.<ref name="pravda">{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/11-10-2005/9051-sharapova-0/|title=Maria Sharapova unwilling to trade her Russian citizenship for anything|publisher=[[Pravda]]|date=October 11, 2005|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref> However, the behavior of Sharapova's father during her matches on the WTA Tour, combined with a perceived lack of commitment by her to the Fed Cup, made her selection for the [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russian Fed Cup team]] controversial in the past.

After Sharapova had beaten fellow Russian [[Anastasia Myskina]] at the [[2004 WTA Tour Championships]], Myskina criticized Sharapova's father, saying: "He was just yelling and screaming instructions to her and I thought he just might jump right on the court at one point in the match." At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: "If she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don't want to be around people like him." [[Larisa Neiland]], assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: "Her father's behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don't see how he could work with the rest of us." However, Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: "I feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia."<ref name="myskina">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4040243.stm|title=Myskina stands by Fed Cup threat|publisher=BBC|date=November 25, 2004|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Sharapova is an aggressive baseliner with power, depth, and angles on her forehand and backhand.<ref name="profile">Jeff Cooper.

Sharapova is known for on-court "[[grunting in tennis|grunting]]", which reached a recorded 101 [[decibel]]s during a match at [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon in 2005]].<ref name="grunting">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4118708.stm|title=Why do women tennis stars grunt?|author=Megan Lane|publisher=BBC|date=June 22, 2005|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref> During her second round match in Birmingham in 2003, Sharapova was asked to tone down the level of her grunt after opponent [[Nathalie Dechy]] complained to the umpire, with Sharapova's response saying that her grunting was "a natural instinct."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/06/12/878185.htm|title=Scream queen Sharapova warned to silence screams|date=June 12, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Monica Seles]] suggested that grunting is involuntary and a part of tennis.<ref name="GruntTelegraph">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1523117/Grunting-is-just-part-of-my-game-claims-Sharapova.html|title=Grunting is just part of my game, claims Sharapova|author=Catriona Davies|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=September 24, 2008|accessdate=October 19, 2008}}</ref> When questioned by the media about her grunting, Sharapova urged the media to "just watch the match."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4649550.stm|title=Beaten Sharapova turns on media|publisher=BBC|date=January 26, 2006|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}</ref> Her defensive game was worked on by her new coach, and this reflected in her results, making consecutive semi-finals at premier mandatory events on the tour. Later in her career, Sharapova also added drop shots to her repertoire, making for a more unpredictable game style.

===Serve===
[[File:Maria Sharapova at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships 12 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sharapova at The Championships, Wimbledon in 2009.]]
Early in her career, Sharapova's first and second serves were regarded as powerful,<ref name="profile"/> and she was believed to possess one of the best deliveries on the Tour.<ref name="Serve1" /> Since the beginning of 2007, however, problems with her shoulder have reduced the effectiveness of her serve.<ref name="Serve1">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3046996|author=Joel Drucker|publisher=ESPN Tennis|title=Lingering injuries or limitations coming to light for Sharapova|date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> The shoulder injury resulted in not only her inconsistent first serves, but also her hitting high numbers of double faults.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071124055318/http://www.tennis.com/features/general/features.aspx?id=108430 "Bottom line for the top women, 2007"], Tennis.com. Retrieved July 23, 2008.</ref> Two-time US Open singles champion [[Tracy Austin]] believes that Sharapova often loses confidence in the rest of her game when she experiences problems with her serve and consequently produces more unforced errors and generally plays more tentatively,<ref name="austin">{{cite web|author=Tracy Austin |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/25396610/ |title=Austin: Sharapova loss a win for Venus and Serena |work=NBC Sports |date=June 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714023402/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/25396610/ |archivedate=July 14, 2008 }}</ref> while tennis writer Joel Drucker remarked that her serve was the "catalyst for her entire game", and that her struggles with it left her "unmasked."<ref name="Serve1" />

In her return from layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an abbreviated motion, which was somewhat less powerful, and though producing aces, also gave a very high number of double faults. After her early loss at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]], Sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. She was able to produce speeds greater than before, including a 121-mph serve hit at the Birmingham tournament in 2010 – the fastest serve of her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/7841792/Wimbledon-2010-Maria-Sharapova-fighting-fit-at-last-and-ready-to-reclaim-her-SW19-crown.html|title=Wimbledon 2010: Maria Sharapova fighting fit at last and ready to reclaim her SW19 crown|author=Mark Hodgkinson|date=June 21, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

However, since her shoulder operation Sharapova was unable to control her serve. This led to numerous faults, as she was unable to feel how much power she was generating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/09/sports/sp-la-women-tennis9|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Diane|last=Pucin|title=Maria Sharapova can't control her serve|date=August 9, 2009}}</ref> The new action led to an elbow injury, and, although under Thomas Högstedt it improved, it could still be erratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.optimumtennis.net/maria-sharapova-serve.htm|title=Maria Sharapova Serve Analysis – A Look Behind the Sharapova Serve Technique|publisher=Optimumtennis.net|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2020|reason =In source is nothing about: The new action led to an elbow injury}} This improvement in serving can be seen in the 2013 Australian Open and following tournaments where Sharapova committed fewer double faults than in previous years. From 2018 through to the end of her career, Sharapova's serve became a major liability, regularly serving between 5 and 10 double faults per match.

===Surfaces===
Because she predicated her game on power, Sharapova's preferred surfaces early in her career were the fast-playing hard and grass courts, as evident through her 25 victories on hard court and grass court.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This was most notable when she won the [[2004 Wimbledon]], [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 U.S. Open]] and [[2008 Australian Open]] crowns, where she had her career breakthrough and played her peak tennis level, respectively.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Sharapova initially was not as well-suited to the slower clay courts as she was on hard and grass courts. Sharapova admitted in 2007 that she was not as comfortable with her movement on clay compared with other court surfaces and once described herself as like a "cow on ice" after a match on clay,<ref name="cow">Barry Flatman. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article1867693.ece Sharapova: a cow on ice?], ''The Times'', May 31, 2007. Retrieved July 23, 2008.</ref> due to her inability to slide. Later in her career, she showed improvement on this surface with respect to experience, as evidenced with her first WTA red-clay title at the [[2010 Internationaux de Strasbourg]], 7 years since playing on the WTA circuit. She won her first French Open title and captured the career grand slam at the [[2012 French Open]] and as of 2014, led the WTA tour of active players with the highest winning percentage on clay, with an 84.25% winning rate.<ref name="tennis.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/04/dont-have-cow/51317/#.U2WX28JOVwU|title=Don't Have a Cow|publisher=}}</ref> Since her shoulder injury, her best surface became clay over grass and hard courts, and with her victory at the [[2014 French Open]], she won the French Open twice, which is more than she won any other slam, and three out of her four last Grand Slam Finals have all been at the French Open (3 consecutive finals from 2012–2014).

Sharapova stated, "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it.

===Citizenship===
Although a [[Lawful permanent residents (United States)|United States resident]] since 1994, Sharapova still prefers Russian citizenship. Sharapova has stated the reason she prefers to keep Russian citizenship is because "it is about the family environment, it is about the rich culture. Just life experiences that I look back to and I know that for so many years I was shaped into the individual I was from those experiences. And not necessarily simply the country, but the people, the mentality and the toughness and that never giving up attitude".<ref>https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/23/maria-sharapova-i-wont-trade-russian-citizenship.html</ref>
