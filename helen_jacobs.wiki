'''Helen Hull Jacobs''' (August 6, 1908 – June 2, 1997) was an American [[tennis]] player who won nine [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles. She was born in [[Globe, Arizona]], United States.

==Early life==
Jacobs was born in [[Globe, Arizona]], and was Jewish.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TBB-BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&dq=Helen+Jacobs+jewish&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWq-brif_aAhXrF5oKHTzqCW0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Helen%20Jacobs%20jewish&f=false ''Beyond Stereotypes: American Jews and Sports in the Twentieth Century'' - Ari F. Sclar<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/49938923/ ''The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle'' from Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 10, 1936<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her parents, Roland and Eula Jacobs, moved the family to San Francisco in 1914.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VZYYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Helen+Jacobs%22+father+tennis+roland&dq=%22Helen+Jacobs%22+father+tennis+roland&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw_8G3j__aAhVFF8AKHdevCb8Q6AEILjAB ''Sports Figures''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Tennis career ==
Jacobs had a powerful serve and overhead smash and a sound backhand, but she never learned to hit a flat forehand, despite her friendship, and some coaching, from [[Bill Tilden]].<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970605/ai_n14105025 Obituary: Helen Jacobs]</ref> Like both her Wightman Cup coach [[Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman]] and her archrival [[Helen Wills Moody]], she grew up in Berkeley, California, learned the game at the Berkeley Tennis Club, pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley and was inducted into the Cal Sports Hall of Fame.

Jacobs won five [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles and was an eleven-time Grand Slam singles runner-up. Six of those losses were to [[Helen Wills Moody]]. Jacobs's only victory over Moody was in the final of the 1933 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]]. Moody retired from the match with a back injury while trailing 3–0 in the third set to a chorus of boos from the audience who believed that Moody quit the match merely to deny Jacobs the satisfaction of finishing out her victory. It was reported by many witnesses after the match that Moody still planned to play her doubles match later that afternoon but was advised against it. Years later, Moody confirmed her injury, saying, "My back is kind of funny. The vertebra between the fourth and fifth disk is thin. When the disk slips around, it's intolerable. It rained the whole week before that final match. I lay in bed, and that was bad because it stiffened worse. I just couldn't play any longer, but I didn't say anything because it would look like an excuse." Jacobs almost defeated Moody again when she had match point at 6–3, 3–6, 5–3 in the [[1935 Wimbledon Championships]] singles final but a mishit on a short lob, which she decided to let bounce, cost her the point and four games later the match.<ref name=nytobit/><ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Wills Moody Achieves Her Ambition|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000325/19350706/005/0001|work=Gloucester Citizen|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|date=6 July 1935|page=1}}</ref> In the [[1938 Wimbledon Championships|1938 Wimbledon]] final against Moody, Jacobs turned her ankle at 4–4 in the first set and hobbled around the court for the remainder of the match, with Moody winning the final eight games and the second set lasting a mere eight minutes. When asked after the match why she did not accept [[Hazel Wightman]]'s on-court advice to quit the match after the injury, Jacobs said that continuing was the sporting thing to do so that Moody could enjoy the full taste of victory, an obvious allusion to Moody's retirement from the 1933 U.S. final. Moody said, "I was very sorry about Helen's ankle. But it couldn't be helped, could it? I thought there was nothing I could do but get it over as quickly as possible." In total, Jacobs lost 14 of the 15 career singles matches she played against Moody.

Jacobs won three Grand Slam women's doubles titles and one in mixed doubles. She was the runner-up at six Grand Slam women's doubles tournaments and one Grand Slam mixed doubles tournament. She won the singles and women's doubles titles at the [[Rome Masters|Italian Championships]] in 1934.

According to [[A. Wallis Myers]] and [[John Olliff]] of ''The Daily Telegraph'' and the ''Daily Mail'', Jacobs was ranked in the world top 10 from 1928 through 1939 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of World No. 1 in those rankings in 1936.<ref>{{cite book |author=Collins, Bud |authorlink=Bud Collins|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis: An Authoritative Encyclopedia and Record Book |publisher=New Chapter Press |location=New York, N.Y |year=2008 |pages=576, 695, 701–2 |isbn=978-0-942257-41-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> With the exceptions of 1930 and 1938, Jacobs was included in the year-end top 10 rankings by the [[United States Tennis Association]] from 1927 through 1941. She was the top-ranked U.S. player from 1932 through 1935.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Tennis Association |title=1988 Official USTA Tennis Yearbook |publisher=H.O. Zimman, Inc. |location=Lynn, Massachusetts |year=1988 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=260}}</ref>

Jacobs was a member of the U.S. [[Wightman Cup]] team from 1927 through 1937 and again in 1939. Her lifetime record was 19–11.

In 1933, Jacobs became the first woman to break with tradition by wearing man-tailored shorts at Wimbledon.

While she was still playing tennis, Jacobs became a writer. Her first books were ''Modern Tennis'' (1933) and ''Improve Your Tennis'' (1936). She also wrote fictional works, such as ''Storm Against the Wind'' (1944). Her autobiography ''Beyond the Game'' appeared in 1936. In 1949, she published ''Gallery of Champions'', a collection of biographies of female players, which she dedicated to [[Molla Mallory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacobs, Helen Hull|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AJacobs%2C+Helen+Hull&dblist=638&fq=ap%3A%22jacobs%2C+helen+hull%22&qt=facet_ap%3A|publisher=[[WorldCat]]}}</ref>

=== Honors and awards ===
Jacobs was named [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year]] in 1933. She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1962. In 2015, she was inducted into the [[National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/2015/7/27/9042113/national-gay-lesbian-sports-hall-fame-megan-rapinoe-robbie-rogers|title=9 inducted into National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame|author=Jim Buzinski|date=27 July 2015|work=Outsports}}</ref>

== World War II and personal life ==

Jacobs served as a commander in the U.S. Navy intelligence during World War II, one of only five women to achieve that rank in the Navy.<ref name=nytobit/>

Long known to have been [[lesbian]], she was in a relationship from 1934 to 1943 with [[Henrietta Bingham]], daughter of Louisville publisher and ambassador to England [[Robert Worth Bingham|Robert Bingham]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Bingham, Emily |title=Irrepressible: The Jazz Age Life of Henrietta Bingham |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York, N.Y |year=2015 |pages=223–266 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Her partner in later life was Virginia Gurnee.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|title=Helen Jacobs, Tennis Champion in the 1930's, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/04/sports/helen-jacobs-tennis-champion-in-the-1930-s-dies-at-88.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 4, 1997}}</ref> Jacobs died of heart failure in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton, New York]] on June 2, 1997, where she had been living.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1bUjCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&dq=%22Helen+Jacobs%22+east+hampton&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi78t-IjP_aAhXF_iwKHYEfAtQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Jacobs%22%20east%20hampton&f=false ''Irrepressible: The Jazz Age Life of Henrietta Bingham'' - Emily Bingham<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Wilson, Scott.
