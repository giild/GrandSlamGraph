'''Althea Neale Gibson''' (August 25, 1927 – September 28, 2003) was an American [[tennis]] player and [[professional golfer]], and one of the first [[Black people|Black]] athletes to cross the color line of international tennis. In 1956, she became the first African American to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] title (the [[French Open|French Championships]]). The following year she won both [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Nationals]] (precursor of the US Open), then won both again in 1958 and was voted [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Female Athlete of the Year]] by the Associated Press in both years.  In all, she won 11 Grand Slam tournaments: five singles titles, five doubles titles, and one mixed doubles title. Gibson was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] and the [[International Women's Sports Hall of Fame]]. "She is one of the greatest players who ever lived," said [[Bob Ryland]], a tennis contemporary and former coach of [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]].  "[[Martina Navratilova|Martina [Navratilova]]] couldn't touch her. I think she'd beat the Williams sisters."{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=214}} In the early 1960s she also became the first Black player to compete on the Women's Professional Golf Tour.

At a time when racism and prejudice were widespread in sports and in society, Gibson was often compared to [[Jackie Robinson]]. "Her road to success was a challenging one," said [[Billie Jean King]], "but I never saw her back down."<ref name="nyt2003">{{cite news |author=Robert McG.

In 1940 a group of Gibson's neighbors took up a collection to finance a junior membership and lessons at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club in the [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]] section of Harlem. At first, Gibson didn't like tennis, a sport she thought was for weak people. "I kept wanting to fight the other player every time I started to lose a match."<ref name=Jacobs/> In 1941 she entered—and won—her first tournament, the [[American Tennis Association]] (ATA) New York State Championship.{{sfn|Gibson|1958|p=30}} She won the ATA national championship in the girls' division in 1944 and 1945, and after losing in the women's final in 1946, won her first of ten straight national ATA women's titles in 1947.{{sfn|Gibson|1958|pp=33–39}} "I knew that I was an unusual, talented girl, through the grace of God," she wrote.

In 1956 Gibson became the first African-American athlete to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament, the [[French Open (tennis)|French Championships]] singles event.

==Professional career==
In late 1958, having won 56 national and international singles and doubles titles, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Prior to the [[Tennis Open Era|Open Era]] there was no prize money at major tournaments, and direct endorsement deals were prohibited. Players were limited to meager expense allowances, strictly regulated by the USTA. "The truth, to put it bluntly, is that my finances were in heartbreaking shape," she wrote. "Being the Queen of Tennis is all well and good, but you can't eat a crown. Nor can you send the Internal Revenue Service a throne clipped to their tax forms. The landlord and grocer and tax collector are funny that way: they like cold cash ... I reign over an empty bank account, and I'm not going to fill it by playing amateur tennis."{{sfn|Gibson and Curtis|1968|pp=15–16}} Professional tours for women were still 15 years away, so her opportunities were largely limited to promotional events.  In 1959 she signed to play a series of exhibition matches against Fageros before [[Harlem Globetrotter]] basketball games.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=131–132}}<ref name="altheagibson1"/> When the tour ended she won the singles and doubles titles at the Pepsi Cola World Pro Tennis Championships in [[Cleveland]], but received only $500 in prize money.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=132–134}}

During this period, Gibson also pursued her long-held aspirations in the entertainment industry. A talented vocalist and saxophonist—and runner-up in the [[Apollo Theater]]'s amateur talent contest in 1943{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=112}}—she made her professional singing debut at [[W. C. Handy]]'s 84th birthday tribute at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in 1957.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=114}}  An executive from [[Dot Records]] was impressed with her performance, and signed her to record an album of popular standards. ''Althea Gibson Sings'' was released in 1959, and Gibson performed two of its songs on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in May and July of that year, but sales were disappointing.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=114–117}} She appeared as a celebrity guest on the TV panel show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and was cast as a slave woman in the [[John Ford]] motion picture ''[[The Horse Soldiers]]'' (1959), which was notable for her refusal to speak in the stereotypic "Negro" dialect mandated by the script.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=120–121}} She also worked as a sports commentator, appeared in print and television advertisements for various products, and increased her involvement in social issues and community activities.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=123}} In 1960 her first memoir, ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody'', written with sportswriter [[Edward E. Fitzgerald|Ed Fitzgerald]], was published.<ref>Gibson A., Fitzgerald E., ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody'' (1960), New York: Harper & Brothers. ASIN B0007G5SL8</ref>

Her professional tennis career, however, was going nowhere. "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, some of whom I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," she wrote. "Suddenly it dawned on me that my triumphs had not destroyed the racial barriers once and for all, as I had—perhaps naively—hoped. Or if I did destroy them, they had been erected behind me again."{{sfn|Gibson and Curtis|1968|p=76}}

In 1964, at the age of 37, Gibson became the first African-American woman to join the [[LPGA|Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA) tour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110307181758/http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?pid=14215&mid=2 Honoring Pioneers – Althea Gibson]</ref> Racial discrimination continued to be a problem: Many hotels still excluded people of color, and country club officials throughout the south—and some in the north—routinely refused to allow her to compete. When she did compete, she was often forced to dress for tournaments in her car because she was banned from the clubhouse.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=154}} Although she was one of the LPGA's top 50 money winners for five years, and won a car at a Dinah Shore tournament, her lifetime golf earnings never exceeded $25,000.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=137–161}} She made financial ends meet with various sponsorship deals and the support of her husband, William Darben, brother of best friend and fellow tennis player Rosemary Darben, whom she married in 1965 (and divorced in 1976).{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=145–146}}

While she broke course records during individual rounds in several tournaments, Gibson's highest ranking was 27th in 1966, and her best tournament finish was a tie for second after a three-way playoff at the 1970 [[Len Immke Buick Open]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical stats for Althea Gibson in the Borden Classic|url=https://www.golfstats.com/search/?tournament=Borden+Classic&tour=&player=Althea+Gibson&submit=go|website=GOLFstats.com}}</ref> She retired from professional golf at the end of the 1978 season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Althea Gibson Career Stats |url=https://www.golfstats.com/search/?player=Althea+Gibson&career=&chart=&box=&tour=&tournament=&yr=&submitted=go |website=Golf Stats |accessdate=September 4, 2018}}</ref> "Althea might have been a real player of consequence had she started when she was young," said [[Judy Rankin]]. "She came along during a difficult time in golf, gained the support of a lot of people, and quietly made a difference."{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=152–153}}

==Post-retirement==
In 1976 Gibson made it to the finals of the ABC television program ''[[Superstars]]'', finishing first in basketball shooting and bowling, and runner-up in softball throwing.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=167}} With the advent of the Open Era she began entering major tennis tournaments again; but by then, in her forties, she was unable to compete effectively against younger players.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=164}} She also attempted a golf comeback, in 1987 at age 60, with the goal of becoming the oldest active tour player, but was unable to regain her tour card.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=167–168}} In a second memoir, ''So Much to Live For'', she articulated her disappointments, including unfulfilled aspirations, the paucity of endorsements and other professional opportunities, and the many obstacles of all sorts that were thrown in her path over the years.<ref>Gibson A., Curtis R., ''So Much to Live For''. New York, Putnam (1968). ASIN: B0006BVL5Q</ref>

In 1972 she began running Pepsi Cola's national mobile tennis project, which brought portable nets and other equipment to underprivileged areas in major cities.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=175}}  She ran multiple other clinics and tennis outreach programs over the next three decades, and coached numerous rising competitors, including [[Leslie Allen (tennis)|Leslie Allen]] and [[Zina Garrison]]. "She pushed me as if I were a pro, not a junior," wrote Garrison in her 2001 memoir.  "I owe the opportunity I received to her."<ref>Garrison Z: ''Zina: My Life in Women's Tennis''. New York, Frog Books (2001), p. 84. {{ISBN|1583940146}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Gibson began directing women's sports and recreation for the [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] Parks Commission in [[New Jersey]]. In 1976 she was appointed New Jersey's athletic commissioner, the first woman in the country to hold such a role, but resigned after one year due to lack of autonomy, budgetary oversight, and adequate funding. "I don't wish to be a figurehead," she said.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=178–180}}  In 1977 she challenged incumbent Essex County State Senator [[Frank J. Dodd]] in the Democratic primary for his seat.<ref>{{cite news |first=Wally |last=Edge |title=The one that starts in the 1960s and ends with Codey |work=PolitickerNJ |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2009|url=http://www.politickernj.com/one-starts-1960s-and-ends-codey-15122}}</ref> She came in second behind Dodd, but ahead of Assemblyman [[Eldridge Hawkins]]. Gibson went on to manage the Department of Recreation in [[East Orange, New Jersey]]. She also served on the State Athletic Control Board and became supervisor of the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=182}} In 1983 she married Sydney Llewellyn, her coach during her peak tennis years. That marriage also ended in divorce, after five years; she had no children.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=169–170}}

In the late 1980s Gibson suffered two [[cerebral hemorrhages]] and in 1992, a [[stroke]]. Ongoing medical expenses depleted her financial resources, leaving her unable to afford her rent or medication. Though she reached out to multiple tennis organizations requesting help, none responded.<ref name = "triumph"/>  Former doubles partner [[Angela Buxton]] made Gibson's plight known to the tennis community, and raised nearly $1 million in donations from around the world.{{sfn|Schoenfeld|2005|pp=220–224}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bloom |first1=Nate |title=Celebrity Jews in the News |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/923/edition_id/7/format/html/displaystory.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120603125024/http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20720/celebrity-jews-in-the-news/ |website=JWeekly |date = October 10, 2003|accessdate=September 4, 2018| archivedate = June 3, 2012}}</ref>

In early 2003 Gibson survived a [[heart attack]], but died on September 28, 2003, at the age of 76 from complications following respiratory and bladder infections. Her body was interred in the [[Rosedale Cemetery, Orange, New Jersey|Rosedale Cemetery in Orange]] near her first husband, Will Darben.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=171, 210}}<ref>{{cite news|first1=George|last1=Vecsey|title=Sport of the times; Gibson deserved a better old age|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/29/sports/sports-of-the-times-gibson-deserved-a-better-old-age.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 29, 2003}}</ref>

It would be 15 years before another non-white woman—[[Evonne Goolagong]], in 1971—won a Grand Slam championship; and 43 years before another African-American woman, [[Serena Williams]], won her first of six US Opens in 1999, not long after faxing a letter and list of questions to Gibson.{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|p=191}} Serena's sister [[Venus Williams|Venus]] then won back-to-back titles at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2000 and 2001, repeating Gibson's accomplishment of 1957 and 1958.

A decade after Gibson's last triumph at the US Nationals, [[Arthur Ashe]] became the first African-American man to win a Grand Slam singles title, at the [[1968 US Open (tennis)|1968 US Open]].

In 1991 Gibson became the first woman to receive the [[Theodore Roosevelt Award]], the highest honor from the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]; she was cited for "symbolizing the best qualities of competitive excellence and good sportsmanship, and for her significant contributions to expanding opportunities for women and minorities through sports."{{sfn|Gray|Lamb|2004|pp=183–184}} ''Sports Illustrated for Women'' named her to its list of the "100 Greatest Female Athletes".<ref>{{cite web |title=100 Greatest Female Athletes. 30.

In a 1977 historical analysis of women in sports, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[William C. Rhoden]] wrote, "Althea Gibson and Wilma Rudolph are, without question, the most significant athletic forces among Black women in sports history. While Rudolph's accomplishments brought more ''visibility'' to women as athletes ... Althea's accomplishments were more ''revolutionary'' because of the psychosocial impact on Black America.  Even to those Blacks who hadn't the slightest idea of where or what Wimbledon was, her victory, like Jackie Robinson's in baseball and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s in boxing, proved again that Blacks, when given an opportunity, could compete at any level in American society."<ref>Rhoden, WT: "A Fruitful Past but a Shaky Future".

"[Her] legacy ... lives on not only in the stadiums of professional tournaments, but also in schools and parks throughout the nation. Every time a Black child or a Hispanic child or an Islamic child picks up a tennis racket for the first time, Althea touches another life. When she began playing, less than five percent of tennis newcomers were minorities. Today, some 30 percent are minorities, two-thirds of whom are African American.
