How well I remember, bedecked by my proud mother in my best clothes, running off to the Club on the Saturday afternoon to play in the final without a vestige of nerve (would that I had none now!), and winning — that was the first really important match of my life."}} She won her first senior singles title in 1893 at [[Ilkley]] <ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Smyth|first1=J.

Her main strengths were her steadiness, temperament and tactical ability.<ref name=oxford/> Her excellent volleying skills stood out at a time when this was still a rarity in ladies tennis.<ref name=myers/>
