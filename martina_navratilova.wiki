'''Martina Navratilova''' ({{lang-cs|Martina Navrátilová}} {{IPA-cs|mar'cɪna navˈraːcɪlovaː|pron}}; born '''Martina Šubertová''' {{IPA-cs|ˈmarcɪna ˈʃubɛrtovaː|pron}}; October 18, 1956) is a Czechoslovak-born American former professional [[tennis]] player and coach. In 2005, ''Tennis'' magazine selected her as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1975 through 2005 and she is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time.<ref name="Brendan Kelly Pub">{{cite book |last1=Landrum |first1=Gene N. |title=Empowerment : the competitive edge in sports, business & life |date=2006 |publisher=Brendan Kelly Pub. |location=Burlington, Ont. |isbn=9781895997248 |page=169}}</ref><ref name="Routledge">{{cite book |last1=Riess |first1=Steven A. |title=Sports in America from Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford, England |isbn=9781317459477 |page=661 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="howtheyplay.com">{{cite web|url=https://howtheyplay.com/individual-sports/Top-10-Greatest-Female-Tennis-Players-of-All-Time|title=Top 10 Greatest Women's Tennis Players of All Time|website=HowTheyPlay}}</ref><ref name="newsday.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/sports/tennis/10-best-women-s-tennis-players-of-all-time-1.10632315|title=10 best women's tennis players of all time|first=2017 10:57|last=Pm|website=Newsday}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Nauright |first1=John |last2=Parrish |first2=Charles |title=Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CAL, United States |isbn=9781598843002 |page=372 |url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=IkLYDgTnMxEC&pg=RA1-PA372&dq=Martina+Navratilova+greatest+female+tennis+player&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj69Mi1iLPcAhXQbn0KHWMXBv44ChDoAQgtMAI#v=onepage&q=Martina%20Navratilova%20greatest%20female%20tennis%20player&f=false |language=en}}</ref>

Navratilova was world No. 1 for a total of 332 weeks in singles, and a record 237 weeks in doubles, making her the only player in history to have held the top spot in both singles and doubles for over 200 weeks. She was year-end singles No. 1 seven times, including a record of five consecutive years, as well as year-end doubles No. 1 five times, including three consecutive years during which she held the ranking for the entire year.

She won 18 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, 31 major women's doubles titles (an all-time record), and 10 major mixed doubles titles, for a combined total of 59 major titles, marking the Open Era record for the most Grand Slam titles won by one player, male or female. She reached the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] singles final 12 times, including for nine consecutive years from 1982 through 1990, and won the women's singles title at Wimbledon a record nine times (surpassing [[Helen Wills|Helen Wills Moody]]'s eight Wimbledon titles),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-07-08/sports/9002270065_1_craig-kardon-wimbledon-judy-nelson |title=A Natural Ninth For Navratilova |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |date=July 8, 1990 |first=Bernie |last=Lincicome |accessdate=September 21, 2014 }}</ref> including a run of six consecutive titles, widely regarded as the best performance by any professional player at a major event. She and [[Billie Jean King]] each won 20 combined Wimbledon titles, an all-time record. Navratilova is also one of just three women ever to have accomplished a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|Career Grand Slam]] in women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles, called the career "[[Grand Slam (tennis)#Boxed Set|Grand Slam Boxed Set]]"; consisting of every senior Grand Slam title, a distinction she shares only with two others, [[Margaret Court]] and [[Doris Hart]].

Navratilova holds the records for most singles (167) and doubles titles (177) in the [[Tennis open era|Open Era]]. Her record as No. 1 in singles (1982–86) remains the most dominant in professional tennis to date. Over five consecutive seasons, she won 428 out of 442 singles matches, averaging fewer than three losses per year to 87 wins, for a sustained winning percentage of 96.8%. She holds the best season win-loss record in the Open Era, 86-1 (98.9%) in 1983, and four out of the top six Open Era seasons. She recorded the longest winning streak in the Open Era (74 consecutive matches) as well as three out of the six longest winning streaks in history.

She and [[Serena Williams]] are the only Open Era players to have won six major singles crowns without the loss of a set. Navratilova, Margaret Court and [[Maureen Connolly]] share the record for the most consecutive major singles titles (six). Navratilova reached 11 consecutive major singles finals, second all-time only to [[Steffi Graf]]'s 13, and is the only woman ever to reach 19 consecutive major semifinals. Navratilova also won the season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]] for top ranked players a record eight times and made the finals a record 14 times. She is the only player of either sex to have won eight different tournaments at least seven times.<ref>[[List of open era tennis records|Open Era records]]</ref> She was ranked in the world's top 10 in singles for a record 20 consecutive years (1975–1994), a span which included 19 years in the top 5, 15 years in the top 3, and 7 years as the world No. 1 ranked singles player. Navratilova is regarded by many to be the greatest female tennis player of all time.

In women's doubles, Navratilova and [[Pam Shriver]] had one of the most successful partnerships in history and won 109 consecutive matches<ref name="espn.com"/> including all four major titles, the doubles Grand Slam, in 1984. The pair set an all-time record of 79 titles together and tied the record set by [[Louise Brough Clapp]] and [[Margaret Osborne duPont]] of 20 major women's doubles titles as a team. Navratilova also won the [[WTA Tour Championships]] doubles title a record 11 times. She is one of only five tennis players of all-time to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Multiple Slam Sets|multiple slam set]] in two disciplines, matched only by Margaret Court, [[Roy Emerson]], [[Frank Sedgman]] and Serena Williams. Navratilova won her last major title in 2006, adding the mixed doubles crown at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]] to her resume just a few weeks before her 50th birthday, 32 years after her first Grand Slam title in 1974.

==Early life and background==
Navratilova was born Martina Šubertová in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. Her parents divorced when she was three,<ref name="Homeland"/> and her mother, an accomplished gymnast, tennis player, and ski instructor,<ref name="outstandingwomen">{{cite book |title=Outstanding Women Athletes: Who They Are and How They Influenced Sports In America |first=Janet |last=Woolum |date=1998 |publisher=Greenwood |page=[https://archive.org/details/outstandingwomen0000wool/page/198 198] |isbn=978-1573561204 |url=https://archive.org/details/outstandingwomen0000wool/page/198 }}</ref> moved the family to [[Řevnice]].<ref name="espn.com">{{cite web|url=https://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016378.html |title=Martina was alone on top |publisher=ESPN.com |date= |first=Larry |last=Schwartz |accessdate=September 21, 2014 }}</ref> In 1962, her mother Jana married Miroslav Navrátil, who became her first tennis coach. Martina then took the name of her stepfather (adding the feminine suffix "ová"), thus becoming Martina Navrátilová ({{IPA-cs|ˈmarcɪna ˈnavraːcɪlovaː|-|Cs-Martina Navratilova.ogg}}). Her father, Mirek (officially Miroslav Šubert),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_Navratilova_Martina.html |title=ESPN Classic - Navratilova owned Wimbledon's Center Court |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=November 19, 2003 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref> was a ski instructor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/plain/A594434 |title=Martina Navratilova - Tennis Player |publisher=BBC |date=April 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2014 }}</ref>

Navratilova has a sister, Jana, and an older paternal half-brother.<ref name="Homeland">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-27/sports/sp-1695_1_martina-navratilova |title=MARTINA : Returning to Homeland, It Hits Her That She Now Is Truly an American |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 27, 2001 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref> Her grandmother, Agnes Semanska, was a tennis player for the Czechoslovak Federation before the [[Second World War]] and had a ranking as high as No. 2 among Czech women during her amateur career.<ref name="outstandingwomen"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/martina-navratilova-10-things-you-213234 |title=Martina Navratilova: 10 things you need to know about the tennis legend |work=Daily Mirror |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2014 }}</ref>

When Navratilova was four, she was hitting a tennis ball off a concrete wall and started to play tennis regularly at age seven.<ref name="espn.com"/> In 1972, at the age of 15, Navratilova won the Czechoslovakia national tennis championship. In 1973, aged 16, she made her debut on the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] professional tour but did not turn professional until 1975. Although perhaps most renowned for her mastery of fast low-bouncing grass, her best early showing at majors was on the red clay at the [[French Open]], where she would go on to reach the final six times. In 1973, she made the quarterfinals where she lost 6–7, 4–6 to [[Evonne Goolagong]]. She made the quarterfinals the next year and lost to [[Helga Masthoff]] (née Niessen), after again losing the first set in a tiebreak.

==Professional tennis career==
Navratilova won her first professional singles title in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1974, at the age of 17. Upon arriving in the United States, Navratilova first lived with former [[Vaudeville]] actress, [[Frances Dewey Wormser]], and her husband, Morton Wormser, a tennis [[enthusiast]].<ref name=spt>{{cite news |title=Frances Dewey Wormser 1903–2008 |url=http://www.santapaulatimes.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/15525/Obituary.html |newspaper=Santa Paula Times |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 19, 2008}}</ref>

Navratilova was the runner-up at two major singles tournaments in 1975. She lost in the final of the Australian Open to Evonne Goolagong and in the final of the French Open to [[Chris Evert]] over three sets. After losing to Evert in the semifinals of that year's [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in September, the 18-year-old Navratilova went to the offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] in New York City and informed them that she wished to [[political asylum|defect]] from Communist Czechoslovakia. Within a month, she received a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] and in 1981 became a US citizen.<ref name=wta40/> Also, in 1975, Navratilova teamed with then world number one, Chris Evert, to win the French Open women's doubles title, Martina's first major title outside of mixed doubles. They teamed again in 1976 to win the women's Wimbledon doubles title over Billie Jean King and Bette Stove.

Navratilova won her first major singles title at [[1978 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon in 1978]], where she defeated Evert in three sets in the final and captured the world No. 1 ranking for the first time on the WTA computer, a position she held until Evert took it back in January 1979. Navratilova successfully defended her Wimbledon title in 1979, again beating Evert in the final in straight sets, and earned the World No. 1 ranking at the end of the year for the first time. Just before Wimbledon in 1979, Navratilova and Evert played possibly the highest scoring women's professional match ever in the [[1979 Colgate International|Eastbourne]] final, in which Evert edged Navratilova 7–5, 5–7, 13-11 after facing match points herself. In April 1981, Evert defeated Navratilova in the finals of the Women's Tennis Association championships, held on clay at [[Amelia Island]], 6–0, 6–0. It was Navratilova's only professional double bagel loss (one she later avenged with a crushing 6–2, 6–0 defeat of Evert in the finals of the same [[Amelia Island]] event in 1984). It was at this point that Navratilova began working with Nancy Lieberman to improve her fitness and toughen her mental approach to better compete with Evert and fulfil her true potential.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-31/sports/sp-21940_1_navratilova-years-martina/2 |title=Jumping Into Retirement : Martina Navratilova Will Go Out at the End of the Year Still Near the Top of the Hill, but It Has Been Quite a Climb |page=2 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=July 31, 1994 |first=Thomas |last=Bonk |accessdate=September 27, 2014 }}</ref> In 1981, Navratilova won her third major singles title by defeating Evert in the final of the Australian Open. Navratilova also defeated Evert to reach the final of the US Open, where she lost a third set tiebreak to Tracy Austin. Navratilova won both Wimbledon and the French Open in 1982.

After adopting basketball player [[Nancy Lieberman]]'s exercise plan and using Yonex isometric midsize graphite-fiberglass composite racquets, Navratilova became the most dominant player in women's tennis. After losing in the fourth round of the first major event of 1983, the [[French Open]], she captured the year's three remaining major titles (the Australian Open was held in December at that time). Navratilova's loss at the French Open was her only singles defeat during that year, during which she established an 86–1 record. Her winning percentage was the best ever for a post-1968 professional tennis player. During 1982, 1983, and 1984, Navratilova lost a total of only six singles matches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martina was alone on top|url=https://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016378.html|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> This included a run of 13 consecutive victories over her closest rival and world-ranked No. 2, Chris Evert. Navratilova's reign from 1982 to 1986 is the most dominant unbroken spell in the professional era.

Navratilova won the 1984 French Open, thus holding all four major singles titles simultaneously. Her accomplishment was declared a "Grand Slam" by [[Philippe Chatrier]], president of the [[International Tennis Federation]], although some tennis observers countered that it was not a true slam because the titles had not been won in a single calendar year. Navratilova extended her major singles tournament winning streak to a record-equalling six following wins at Wimbledon and the US Open. Navratilova's victory meant she became the first player to win majors on clay, grass and hard court on the same year. She entered the 1984 Australian Open with a chance of winning all four titles in the same year. In the semifinals, however, [[Helena Suková]] ended [[Martina Navrátilová's 74-match winning streak in 1984|Navratilova's 74-match winning streak]] (a record for a professional) 1–6, 6–3, 7–5.<ref>{{cite news|title=Upset Snaps Navratilova's Streak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/12.06.html|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

A left-hander, Navratilova completed a calendar grand slam in women's doubles in 1984, partnering right-handed [[Pam Shriver]], a tall and talented player whose most noted stroke was a slice forehand, a shot virtually unheard of in the game today. This was part of a record 109-match winning streak that the pair achieved between 1983 and 1985. (Navratilova was ranked the world No. 1 doubles player for a period of over three years in the 1980s.) From 1985 through 1987, Navratilova reached the women's singles final at all 11 major tournaments held during those three years, winning six of them. From 1982 through 1990, she reached the Wimbledon final nine consecutive times. She reached the US Open final five consecutive times from 1983 through 1987 and appeared in the French Open final five out of six years from 1982 through 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title=WTA Records|url=http://tennisbios.com/view/tennis-wta-records|publisher=Tennis Bios|access-date=January 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529163048/http://tennisbios.com/view/tennis-wta-records|archive-date=May 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1985, Navratilova played in what many consider to be perhaps the best woman's match of all time, the French Open final against Chris Evert. Navratilova battled back from 3–6, 2–4 down to 5-5 all in the third set, before Evert hit a winning backhand passing shot on match point to defeat Navratilova 6–3, 6–7(4), 7–5. This was a major turnaround for Evert, who was so outmatched the year earlier in the final that [[Bud Collins]] remarked as a TV commentator that the sport needed to create a higher league for Navratilova to compete in. In outdoor matches against Evert, Navratilova led 10–5 on grass and 9–7 on hardcourts, while Evert was up 11–3 on clay. On indoor courts, however, Navratilova had a decisive 21–14 lead. At the end of what is widely regarded as the greatest rivalry in women's tennis, Navratilova led Evert 43–37 in total matches, 14–8 in Grand Slams and 10–4 in Grand Slam finals.

In 1986 at the U.S. Open, Navratilova prevailed over sixteen-year-old German [[Steffi Graf]] in a close semi-final winning 6-1, 6-7 (7-3), 7-6 (10-8),<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-09-07/sports/8602230305_1_third-set-tiebreaker-backhand-point Navratilova Pushed To Limit Before Ousting Upstart Graf], ''SunSentinel'' [Florida, U.S.], Jim Sarni, Sept. 7, 1986.</ref> before handily winning the final over Helena Sukova 6-3, 6-2. Navratilova, with partner Pam Shriver, also won the women's doubles title.<ref>[https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0909/pten.html Lendl, Navratilova cemented No. 1 rankings with Open wins.

Graf dominated the first half of the 1987 season including defeating Navratilova in straight sets in the semi-finals of the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] and in the final of the French Open, 6–4, 4–6, 8–6. However, Navratilova defeated Graf in straight sets in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open  (and at the US Open became only the third player in the Open Era, joining tennis legends Margaret Court and Billie Jean King, to win the women's singles, women's doubles, and [[Types of tennis match|mixed doubles]] at the same event—the rare "[[Grand Slam (tennis)#Triple Crown|Triple Crown]]"). Navratilova reached all four Grand Slam finals in 1987, winning two of them (she lost the [[Australian Open]] to Hana Mandlikova). Graf's two losses to Navratilova were her only losses of the year and with 11 tournament wins over the year versus 4 for Navratilova she was able to obtain year-end world No. 1 ranking ahead of Navratilova at No. 2. Graf eventually broke Navratilova's records of 156 consecutive weeks and 331 total weeks as the world No. 1 singles player but fell 60 short of Navratilova's record of 167 singles titles. Including doubles, Navratilova won almost three times as many titles as Graf with a record doubles/mixed/singles combined total of 344 titles to Graf's 118.

In 1988, Graf won all four major singles titles, beating the 31-year-old Navratilova 5–7, 6–2, 6–1 in the Wimbledon final, their only match of the year, recovering from a set and a break down.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2014/jun/25/wimbledon-edberg-graf-british-disappointment-1988| title=Remembering Edberg, Graf, and British disappointment at Wimbledon 1988| last1=Pye| first1=Stephen| date=June 25, 2014 | work=[[The Guardian]]| accessdate=September 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Peter Alfano|title=Wimbledon; An Era Ends as Graf Beats Navratilova|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/03/sports/wimbledon-an-era-ends-as-graf-beats-navratilova.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 3, 1988}}</ref>  Navratilova did not reach the finals of any of the other Grand Slam events but did win nine tournaments enabling her to claim the No. 2 ranking behind Graf.

In 1989, Graf and Navratilova met in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open, with Graf winning both encounters 6-1 in the third set. Graf also defeated Navratilova in the finals of the [[WTA Tour Championships]] their third and final match of the year. Navratilova, who skipped the French Open that year, did win eight titles and was able to capture the No. 2 ranking behind Graf for the third straight year.  Despite the 13 year age difference between the two players, and Graf's comparative lack of investment in doubles and mixed doubles, Navratilova won 9 of the 18 career singles matches with Graf and 5 of the 9 major singles matches with her. At age 34, Navratilova defeated Graf the last time they played in a major in the semifinals of the [[1991 US Open (tennis)|1991 US Open]] 7–6(2), 6–7(6), 6–4, to end their Grand Slam rivalry 5-4 up, although it is noteworthy that all 4 of Graf's Grand Slam victories over Navratilova came in the finals of a Slam. This is reflected in the Grand Slams Finals chart below.

Navratilova's final Grand Slam singles triumph was in 1990. In the final at Wimbledon, the 33-year-old Navratilova swept [[Zina Garrison]] 6–4, 6–1 to claim an all-time record ninth Wimbledon singles crown. She won four other tournaments that year, although she did not participate in the Australian or French Opens, and finished the year ranked No. 3 in the world, narrowing edge out by sixteen-year-old [[Monika Seles]] for the No. 2 spot. Though that was her last major singles title, Navratilova reached two additional major singles finals during the remainder of career: in 1991, she lost in the US Open final to the new world No. 1, [[Monica Seles]]; and, in 1994, at age 37, Navratilova reached the Wimbledon final, where she lost in three sets to [[Conchita Martínez]]. In November that year, after losing to [[Gabriela Sabatini]] in the first round of the [[1994 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]], she retired from full-time competition on the singles tour.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Charles Bricker|title=Game, Set, Career: Martina|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-11-20/sports/9411200139_1_martina-navratilova-professional-tennis-tennis-career|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|accessdate=April 23, 2017|date=November 20, 1994}}</ref> She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 2000.

In 2000, Navratilova returned to the tour to mostly play doubles events, while rarely also playing singles. In her first singles performance in eight years, at [[International Women's Open|Eastbourne]] in 2002, she beat world No. 22, [[Tatiana Panova]], before losing in the next round to [[Daniela Hantuchová]] in three sets. In 2003, she won the mixed doubles titles at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, partnering [[Leander Paes]]. This made her the oldest ever major champion (aged 46 years, 8 months). The Australian Open victory made her the third player in history to complete a "boxed set" of major titles by winning the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles at all four majors. The Wimbledon win allowed her to equal Billie Jean King's record of 20 Wimbledon titles (in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles combined) and extended her overall number of major titles to 58 (second only to Margaret Court, who won 62).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon legends: Martina Navratilova|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742061.stm|publisher=BBC|date=May 26, 2004}}</ref> Despite being criticized for receiving a wildcard, Navratilova won a singles match over [[Catalina Castaño]] 6–0 6–1 at the first round of Wimbledon in 2004, aged 47 years and eight months, to make her the oldest player to win a professional singles match in the open era. Navratilova then lost her second round match with [[Gisela Dulko]] in three sets.

On Thursday, July 6, 2006, Navratilova played her last matches at Wimbledon, with partner Liezel Huber losing a quarterfinal match in women's doubles to fourth seeds and eventual champions [[Yan Zi (tennis)|Yan Zi]] and [[Zheng Jie]], and later in the same day with partner Mark Knowles losing in the third round of mixed doubles to eventual champions [[Andy Ram]] and [[Vera Zvonareva]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/jul/07/wimbledon2006.wimbledon4 Navratilova departs in silence after losing doubly in doubles], ''The Guardian'' [UK], Mike Anstead, 6 July 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.eurosport.com/tennis/wimbledon/2006/martina-takes-final-bow_sto921114/story.shtml Martina takes final bow], Eurosport (Reuters), 6 July 2006.</ref> She had said that her last Wimbledon wasn't about breaking her record shared with Billie Jean King of 20 championships. In an interview, Navratilova was quoted as saying, "People keep saying that, but it so wasn't. I just wanted to win one more title here, period."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/martina-navratilova-it-wasnt-about-the-record-but-no-one-believed-me-407123.html Martina Navratilova: 'It wasn't about the record, but no one believed me'], ''The Independent'' [UK], Brian Viner, 8 July 2006.</ref>

Navratilova capped off her career by winning the mixed doubles title, her 41st major doubles title (31 in women's doubles and 10 in mixed doubles) and 177th overall, at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]] with American doubles specialist [[Bob Bryan]]. At the time, she was only about a month shy of her 50th birthday and broke her own record as the oldest ever major champion (aged 49 years, 10 months).

Navratilova won 167 top-level singles titles (more than any other player in the open era) and 177 doubles titles. Her last title in women's doubles came on August 21, 2006, at the [[Tier I]] [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, where she partnered [[Nadia Petrova]]. Navratilova won 18 major singles titles: nine at Wimbledon, four at the US Open, three at the Australian Open, and two at the French Open. Her overall record in 67 major singles events was 306–49 (120–14 at Wimbledon, 89–17 at the US Open, 51–11 at the French Open, and 46–7 at the Australian Open). Some observers argue that the very few singles matches she played in her forties should be counted separately in her career statistics. She is the only player to have won at least one tour event for 21 consecutive years and won the singles and doubles at the same event a record 84 times. She was ranked in the world top 3 in singles for 15 years between 1977 and 1993. Her career singles match win total of 1,442 is the most during the open era.<ref>{{cite web|title=NO.1 SPOTLIGHT: MARTINA NAVRATILOVA|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/40love/article/3147284/title/no1-spotlight-martina-navratilova|publisher=WTA Tennis|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405232947/http://www.wtatennis.com/40love/article/3147284/title/no1-spotlight-martina-navratilova|archivedate=April 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Health problems===
According to the ''New York Times''' [[Jane Brody|Jane E.

(Shriver—Navratilova's [[1982 US Open – Women's Doubles#Seeds|doubles partner in the same tournament]]—subsequently lost to No. 5 seed [[Hana Mandlíková]] in the semifinal.

==== Gay rights ====
Navratilova participated in a lawsuit against [[Romer v.

==== Communism and Republicans ====
She has spoken out on a number of volatile political issues, including [[tort]]/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme—aside from gay and lesbian rights—has been her unstinting opposition to Communism, and unrelenting opposition to the former Eastern Bloc power structure that compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's former hegemony over Eastern Europe.

<blockquote>Whenever people go into politics and they try to say that Communism was a good thing, I say, 'Go ahead and live in a Communist country then, if you think it's so great.' "<ref name=lopate/></blockquote>

Navratilova was a guest on CNN's ''[[Connie Chung]] Tonight'' show on July 17, 2002. During the show, Chung quoted a German newspaper which quoted Navratilova as saying:

<blockquote>The most absurd part of my escape from the unjust system is that I have exchanged one system that suppresses free opinion for another. The Republicans in the U.S. manipulate public opinion and sweep controversial issues under the table. It's depressing. Decisions in America are based solely on the question of how much money will come out of it and not on the questions of how much health, morals or environment suffer as a result.<ref name="CNN_Chung" /></blockquote>

Navratilova said that the remarks referred to what she perceived as a trend of centralization of government power and a loss of personal freedom. In the discussion that followed, Chung stated:

<blockquote>Can I be honest with you? I can tell you that when I read this, I have to tell you that I thought it was un-American, unpatriotic. I wanted to say, go back to Czechoslovakia. You know, if you don't like it here, this a country that gave you so much, gave you the freedom to do what you want.<ref name="CNN_Chung" /></blockquote>

Navratilova responded,

<blockquote>And I'm giving it back. This is why I speak out. When I see something that I don't like, I'm going to speak out because you can do that here. And again, I feel there are too many things happening that are taking our rights away.<ref name="CNN_Chung">"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/17/cct.00.html Navratilova Sets the Record Straight ]"-Transcript, ''Connie Chung Tonight'' (CNN), Aired July 17, 2002</ref></blockquote>

Navratilova was quoted in 2007 as being ashamed of the US under President [[George W. Bush]] because unlike the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Bush was democratically elected.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581428/Martina-Navratilova-is-now-Czech-again.html "Martina Navratilova is now Czech again"].

==== Transgender athletes ====
Navratilova is critical of allowing trans women to compete in women's sports, unless "fair". She rejects accusations of transphobia, and says she deplores "a growing tendency among transgender activists to denounce anyone who argues against them and to label them all as 'transphobes.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/18/tennis/martina-navratilova-trans-women-comments-spt-scli-intl/index.html|title=Martina Navratilova criticized over 'transphobic' comments|date=February 18, 2019|first=James|last=Masters|website=CNN}}</ref> Following an article on the subject that Navratilova wrote for ''The Times'' in February 2019, [[Athlete Ally]], an LGBTQ athlete advocacy group, removed Navratilova from their advisory board, stating her comments "are transphobic [and] based on a false understanding of science and data".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-rules-on-trans-athletes-reward-cheats-and-punish-the-innocent-klsrq6h3x|title=The rules on trans athletes reward cheats and punish the innocent|first=Martina|last=Navratilova|date=February 17, 2019|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190217022611/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-rules-on-trans-athletes-reward-cheats-and-punish-the-innocent-klsrq6h3x?shareToken=5feda18499a43666c647b35d0afca9ff|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47301007|title=Navratilova transgender comments spark row|date=February 20, 2019|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |last=Hoffman |first=Joanna |date=2019-02-19 |title=Athlete Ally: Navratilova’s Statements Transphobic and Counter to our Work, Vision and Values |url=https://www.athleteally.org/navratilovas-statements-transphobic-counter-to-our-work-vision/ |location=New York, NY |publisher=Athlete Ally|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>

In March 2019, Navratilova apologized for using the term "cheating" when discussing whether transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in women's sport. She also called for "a debate, a conversation that includes everyone and is based, as I have said, not on feeling or emotion but science."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/47433144|title=Martina Navratilova sorry for transgender 'cheat' language as she re-enters debate|date=2019-03-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2019-03-03|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In an April 2019 article for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', she opined that the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], in its current form, "would make it unlawful to differentiate among girls and women in sports on the basis of sex for any purpose".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/pass-the-equality-act-but-dont-abandon-title-ix/2019/04/29/2dae7e58-65ed-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Pass the Equality Act, but don’t abandon Title IX|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>

In June 2019, the [[BBC]] broadcast "The Trans Women Athlete Dispute with Martina Navratilova", where she interviewed people including trans women athletes and sports researchers, presenting evidence on both sides of the debate of whether trans women have any advantage in elite sports. Her closing remarks were "The way I started this journey, I just wanted to see if there are any big surprises, any misconceptions that I had.
And what I think I have come to realise, the biggest thing for me, is just that the level of difficulty that trans people go through cannot be underestimated. The fight for equality and recognition is just huge. That being said, still, for me, the most important thing in sports... and you have to remember, trans rights and elite sports are two different things, although of course they are connected. What's the right way to set rules so that everybody feels like they have a fighting chance? It feels to me that it is impossible to come to any real conclusions or write any meaningful rules until more research is done.

But for now, I think we need to include as many transgender athletes as possible within elite sports, while keeping it as level a playing field as possible. Look, society has changed so much. Things evolve, things change and maybe I need to evolve, I need to change. The rules certainly need to evolve. If you don't adapt, you've got problems. And so we'll just keep adapting and try to find a happy way forward."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00069nr/the-trans-women-athlete-dispute-with-martina-navratilova|title=The Trans Women Athlete Dispute with Martina Navratilova|date=2019-06-26|work=BBC TV|language=en-GB}}</ref>
