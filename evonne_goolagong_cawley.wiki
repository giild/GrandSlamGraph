'''Evonne Fay Goolagong Cawley''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC|MBE}} (born 31 July 1951), known as '''Evonne Goolagong''' in her earlier career, is an Australian former world No. 1 [[tennis]] player. She was one of the world's leading players in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the number one Australian pro on tour after the retirement of [[Margaret Court]]. At the age of 19, Goolagong won the French Open singles crown and the Australian Open doubles championships (with Margaret Court). She followed those up two months later with a victory in ladies singles at Wimbledon. In 1980, she became the first mother to win Wimbledon in 66 years. Goolagong would go on to win 14 [[Grand Slam title|Grand Slam]] tournament titles: seven in singles (four at the [[Australian Open]], two at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and one at the [[French Open]]), six in women's doubles, and one in mixed doubles. She represented Australia in three Fed Cup competitions winning the title (1971, 1973, 1974), and was Fed Cup captain for three consecutive years.

Goolagong was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1972 and Officer of the Order of Australia in 1982. She was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1988. Tennis Australia has appointed Goolagong as an "Ambassador for the Sport of Tennis in Australia."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.evonnegoolagongfoundation.org.au/about | title=Evonne Goolagong Foundation info | accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>

Since 2005, she has run the Goolagong National Development Camp for Indigenous boys and girls, to help promote better health, education and employment.

In the [[New South Wales]] town [[Barellan]], where she grew up, there is a giant tennis racquet erected with her name on it. The racquet, which was unveiled in Evonne Goolagong Park in October 2009 during the Barellan Centenary celebrations, is an exact 20:1 scale model of her battered wooden signature Dunlop racquet.

==Early life==
Born Evonne Fay Goolagong, she is the third of eight children<ref>{{cite news|author1=Judy Klemesrud|title=Goolagong discusses aborigine roots|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DAAhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DHUFAAAAIBAJ&dq=roger-cawley%20husband&pg=1217%2C50984|work=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]|date=1 November 1980|page=11|via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> from an [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] family. Her parents, Kenny Goolagong (an itinerant [[sheep shearer]]) and Melinda, are members of the [[Wiradjuri]] people. She was born in [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], New South Wales, and grew up in the small country town of [[Barellan, New South Wales|Barellan]]. Although Aboriginal people faced widespread discrimination in rural Australia at this time, Goolagong was able to play tennis in Barellan from childhood thanks to a local resident, Bill Kurtzman, who saw her peering through the fence at the local courts and encouraged her to come in and play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/29/tennis/evonne-goolagong-cawley-australian-open/|title=Evonne Goolagong: Defying prejudice to become a star|author=Matt Majendie, for CNN|date=30 January 2015|work=CNN}}</ref> In 1965, Vic Edwards, the proprietor of a tennis school in [[Sydney]], was tipped off by two of his assistants, travelled to Barellan to take a look at the young Goolagong, and immediately saw her potential. He persuaded Goolagong's parents to allow her to move to Sydney, where she attended [[Willoughby Girls High School]]. Here, she completed her School Certificate in 1968 and was at the same time coached by Edwards and lived in his household.

==Career and Grand Slam success==
With seven championships, Goolagong is 12th on the women's [[List of Grand Slam women's singles champions#Most Grand Slam tournament singles titles|list of all-time singles Grand Slam winners]], and ended her career with 82 singles titles. She took singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles at the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon. She never won at the US Open. She won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career, reaching a total of 18 Grand Slam singles finals. During the 1970s, she played in 17 Grand Slam singles finals, a period record for any player, man or woman. From her first Grand Slam singles final appearance in January 1971, to December 1977 when she won her last Grand Slam title of the 1970s, she played in 21 Grand Slam events. Her only four defeats prior to the finals came at the 1972 US Open in the third round; 1974 Wimbledon, where she was defeated in the quarterfinals; and at the semifinal stage at both Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 1973. To start the decade, she was defeated at the 1970 Australian Open in the quarterfinals and in the second round of the 1970 Wimbledon. In 1971, 1975, 1976 and 1977, Goolagong reached the final of every Grand Slam championship in which she competed. Between 1973 and 1977, she reached the final of almost every Grand Slam singles event she entered. The exceptions were: Roland Garros, where she lost to [[Margaret Court Smith]] in the semifinals in 1973; and Wimbledon, where she played in only two finals in that period, 1975 and 1976, losing both; she lost in 1973 to eventual champion [[Billie Jean King]] in the semifinals; and in 1974 to Australian [[Kerry Reid|Kerry Melville]] at the quarterfinal stage; she did not enter in 1977, the year her daughter was born. Also in 1974, she teamed up with [[Peggy Michel]] to win the ladies' doubles title. She won the women's doubles title at the Australian Open five times and in Roland Garros once, as well as mixed doubles at Roland Garros once.

Following her victory at the season-ending WTA Championships in 1976<ref>{{cite magazine|author1=Joe Jares|title=A net gain for concentration|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=26 April 1976|volume=44|issue=17|pages=28–30, 33|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/43338/30/2}}</ref>—known at the time as the [[1976 Virginia Slims Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]]—her seventh tournament victory of the year, Goolagong continued to play on the [[WTA Tour]] until 1983, but never again played a full season. After her victory over [[Chris Evert]] in the WTA Championships, she only played in three competitive tournaments for the remainder of 1976, losing in both finals to Evert (Wimbledon and US Open) and the Sydney quarterfinals in November, which she played while four months pregnant. She focused instead on [[World Team Tennis|WTT Team Tennis]] and exhibition events.

Goolagong realised during the [[1976 US Open – Women's Singles|1976 US Open]] final that she was pregnant and after one more tournament for the year, she did not play again on the regular tour until the summer of 1977, continuing through to Wimbledon 1978. 1976 had been her best season to date, winning seven titles, rising to number one in the world and losing only to Chris Evert, which she did five times and once to Dianne Fromholtz in Sydney, which she played in the second trimester of her pregnancy. No other players were able to score a victory over her in the year. After attempting a comeback in the summer of 1977, Goolagong decided to wait for the Australian season beginning later in the year for a full return. Her return to the tour proper kick-started a highly successful run of play, during which she won ten tournaments including the Australian Open in a run of five consecutive tournament wins and reached the final in two others, including the season-ending WTA Championships, where she lost to Martina Navratilova. At the Virginia Slims of Boston in March 1978, Goolagong beat both Martina Navratilova & Chris Evert back-to-back to win the title. It was her only post pregnancy victory of Navratilova and one of only two she scored over Evert. From being un-ranked at the beginning of her return, Goolagong's ranking rose to No. 3 in the world, but during Wimbledon 1978, a career-threatening ankle injury forced her to miss the remainder of 1978 (other than an exhibition event played in December) and she did not return to competitive play until March 1979, when she won four tournaments and ended the year ranked No. 4 in the world. Injuries at the beginning of 1980 kept her away from the tour for many weeks in the first six months of the year, but she returned in triumph at Wimbledon, yet only played three further tournaments for the remainder of the year after her final Grand Slam victory. She withdrew from the US Open, where she had been seeded fourth, due to a recurring back injury and the early stages of her second pregnancy, although she did play the Australian Open championships at the end of the year, despite her advancing pregnancy. Goolagong was then absent for almost all of 1981, returning to tournament play in Australia towards the end of the year and reaching the quarterfinals of the first two tournaments she played, losing to Evert in Sydney, and at the Australian Open to Navratilova. Her comeback wasn't consistent and, despite pushing Evert to three sets and beating reigning French Open champion Hana Mandlikova in the Citizen Cup played on clay in March 1982, she only played sporadically through the year. She reached just one singles final at Sydney, where she lost in three sets to Navratilova, and lost her only match at Wimbledon to [[Zina Garrison]] before retiring after Wimbledon 1983.

She is the only mother to have won the Wimbledon title since [[Dorothea Lambert Chambers]] in 1914. Married to Roger Cawley in 1975, she had a daughter in 1977.

Goolagong reached four consecutive [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] singles finals, from 1973 to 1976, but lost them all. She is the only player in U.S. Championships history to have lost four consecutive finals.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Open – Women's Singles Champions 1887–2015|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/event_guide/history/wschamps.html|website=www.usopen.org|publisher=[[USTA]]}}</ref> Goolagong made seven consecutive finals at the Australian Open, winning three titles in a row. Despite reaching the final at her first two appearances in 1971 and 1972, after 1973 Goolagong did not compete at the Roland Garros for a decade. The French Tennis Federation banned all World Team Tennis contracted players from the 1974 event, with the player's unions instigating legal action against the French authorities. As [[Jimmy Connors]] and Goolagong were the reigning Australian Open champions, they spearheaded the legal action as they were being deprived of the opportunity to attain the tennis calendar Grand Slam as a result of the decision. Connors admitted this was a huge distraction and later wrote both he and Goolagong were "hung out to dry".<ref>Connors, Jimmy. "The Outsider: My Autobiography". Corgi Paperback – 5 June 2014. {{ISBN|978-0552166416}}</ref> Goolagong boycotted the event even after the ban was lifted, but returned in 1983 for her final Grand Slam singles appearance. She lost in the last thirty-two to Chris Evert and did not compete in any further Grand Slam singles events. Her last appearance at Grand Slam level came at the following [[1983 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles#Section 4|1983 Wimbledon Championships]] when she partnered [[Sue Barker]] to a first-round defeat in the doubles, having withdrawn from the singles event earlier.

Her career win-loss percentage was 81.01% (704–165). Her win-loss performance in all Grand Slam singles tournaments was 82.09% (133–29), at the French Open 84.21% (16–3), at Wimbledon 83.33% (50–10), at the US Open 81.25% (26–6), and at the Australian Open 80.39% (41–10).

Goolagong was ranked No. 1 in the world in women's tennis for two weeks in 1976, but it was not reported at the time because incomplete data was used to calculate the rankings. This was discovered in December 2007, 31 years later. She was the second woman to hold the top spot, but the 16th at the time she was finally recognized.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3169960 Computer glitch denied Goolagong No. 1 WTA ranking in '76], Associated Press, ESPN Sports, 31 December 2007.</ref>

==Life after touring==
Goolagong spent some time as a touring professional at the Hilton Head Racquet Club in South Carolina before returning to Australia.<ref name="independent">{{cite news|author1=John Roberts|title=Where Are they Now?

Goolagong was a member of the Board of the [[Australian Sports Commission]] from 1995 to 1997 and since 1997 has held the position of Sports Ambassador to Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islander]] Communities. She was appointed captain of the Australian Fed Cup team in 2002. In 2003, she was winner for the Oceania region of the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s 2003 "Women and Sports Trophy". She also runs an annual "Goolagong National Development Camp", with the aim of encouraging Aboriginal children to stay in school through playing competitive tennis.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2008-01-13-2268572235_x.htm Grand Slam champ Evonne Goolagong uses camp to search for next aboriginal player or coach], 13 January 2008, By Dennis Passa, AP Sports Writer, ''USA Today''.</ref>

==Personal life==
While competing in the doubles event of the Wimbledon warm-up event in [[Eastbourne]] (she did not enter the singles competition), Goolagong married former junior British tennis player Roger Cawley in London, on 19 June 1975.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Thomas Rogers|title=People in Sports|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/20/archives/people-in-sports-evonne-goolagong-married.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=14|date=20 June 1975}}</ref> She continued in the doubles tournament, losing two days later in the final partnering with [[Peggy Michel]]. As the draw had already taken place prior to the marriage ceremony, Wimbledon was unable to record her entry as Mrs R.A. Cawley in the official draw sheet until the second round. Following her wedding, she settled in [[Naples, Florida]].

After living in the U.S. for eight years, the couple bought a home in [[Noosa Heads, Queensland]], where they settled with their two United States-born children, Kelly and Morgan.
