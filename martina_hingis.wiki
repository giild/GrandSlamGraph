Hingis set a series of "youngest-ever" records during the 1990s, including youngest-ever Grand Slam champion and youngest-ever world No. 1. Before [[ligament]] injuries in both ankles forced her to withdraw temporarily from professional tennis in early 2003, at the age of 22, she had won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles titles and, according to ''[[Forbes]]'', was the highest-paid female athlete in the world for five consecutive years, 1997 to 2001.<ref name="topend">{{cite web |url=http://www.topendsports.com/world/lists/earnings/women-paid.htm |title=World's Highest Paid Women Athletes |accessdate=2 November 2015 |publisher=Top End Sports}}</ref><ref name="usatoday30">{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/snapshot/sports/2001-07-17-highest-paid-female-athletes.htm |title=Highest-paid female athletes |accessdate=2 November 2015 |work=USA Today}}</ref> After several surgeries and long recoveries, Hingis returned to the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tour in 2006, climbing to world No. 6, winning two Tier I tournaments, and also receiving the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year]].<ref name="azplayers" /> She retired in November 2007 after being hampered by a hip injury for several months and testing positive for a [[metabolite]] of cocaine during that year's Wimbledon Championships, which led to a two-year suspension from the sport.

In 1997, Hingis became the undisputed World No. 1 women's tennis player. She started the year by winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. She then became the youngest [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles winner in the 20th century by winning the Australian Open at age 16 years and 3 months (beating former champion [[Mary Pierce]] in the final).

In July, she became the youngest singles champion at Wimbledon since [[Lottie Dod]] in 1887 by beating [[Jana Novotná]] in the final. She then defeated another up-and-coming player, [[Venus Williams]], in the final of the US Open. The only Grand Slam singles title that Hingis failed to win in 1997 was the French Open, where she lost in the final to [[Iva Majoli]].

===1998===
In 1998, Hingis won all four of the Grand Slam women's doubles titles, only the fourth in women's tennis history to do so,<ref>[http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/martinahingis_trivia1.html Martina Hingis News and Trivias at] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118015826/http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/martinahingis_trivia1.html |date=18 January 2010 }}.

She then reached the French Open final and was three points away from victory in the second set before losing to Steffi Graf about whom she had said before: "Steffi had some results in the past, but it's a faster, more athletic game now... She is old now. Her time has passed."

===2000===
In 2000, Hingis again found herself in both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open. This time, however, she lost both. Her three-year hold on the singles championship ended when she lost to Davenport. Later, Hingis and Mary Pierce, her new doubles partner, lost to [[Lisa Raymond]] and [[Rennae Stubbs]]. Hingis captured the French Open women's doubles title with Pierce and produced consistent results in singles tournaments throughout the year. She reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing to Venus Williams. Although she did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament, she kept the year end No. 1 ranking because of nine tournament championships, including the WTA Tour Championships where she won the singles and doubles titles.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Hingis reached her fifth consecutive [[2001 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] final in 2001, defeating both of the [[Williams sisters]] en route, before losing to [[Jennifer Capriati]]. She briefly ended her coaching relationship with her mother Melanie early in the year<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/1323400.stm |work=BBC News |title=Mum's the word for Hingis |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> but had a change of heart two months later just before the French Open. 2001 was her least successful year in several seasons, with only three tournament victories in total. She lost her No. 1 ranking for the last time (to Jennifer Capriati) on 14 October 2001. In that same month, Hingis underwent surgery on her right ankle.

===2002===
Coming back from injury, Hingis won the Australian Open doubles final at the start of 2002 (again teaming with Anna Kournikova) and reached a sixth straight Australian Open final in singles, again facing Capriati. Hingis led by a set and 4–0 and had four match points but lost in three sets. In May 2002, she needed another ankle ligament operation, this time on her left ankle. After that, she continued to struggle with injuries and was not able to recapture her best form.

In February 2003, at the age of 22, Hingis announced her retirement from tennis, due to her injuries and being in pain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/2735931.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hingis quits tennis |date=7 February 2003 |accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> "I want to play tennis only for fun and concentrate more on horse riding and finish my studies."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200302/s780193.htm |title=Hingis reiterates retirement decision. 10/2/2003.

===2005===
In February 2005, Hingis made an unsuccessful return to competition at an event in [[Pattaya]], Thailand, where she lost to Germany's [[Marlene Weingärtner]] in the first round. After the loss, she claimed that she had no further plans for a comeback.

Hingis, however, resurfaced in July, playing singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in [[World Team Tennis]] and notching up singles victories over two top 100 players and shutting out Martina Navratilova in singles on 7 July. With these promising results behind her, Hingis announced on 29 November her return to the [[WTA Tour]] in 2006.

===2006===
At the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Hingis lost in the quarterfinals to second-seeded [[Kim Clijsters]]. However, Hingis won the mixed doubles title with [[Mahesh Bhupathi]] of India. This was her first career [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] mixed doubles title and fifteenth overall (5 singles, 9 women's doubles, 1 mixed doubles).

The week after the Australian Open, Hingis defeated world No. 4 [[Maria Sharapova]] in the semifinals of the [[Tier I]] [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]] in Tokyo before losing in the final to world No. 9 [[Elena Dementieva]]. Hingis competed in Dubai then, reaching the quarterfinals before falling to Sharapova. At the Tier I [[Pacific Life Open]] in Indian Wells, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round before again losing to Sharapova in the semifinals.

[[File:Martina Hingis am Zurich Open 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Martina Hingis at the Zurich Open, 2006]]
At the Tier I [[Rome Masters|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome, Hingis posted her 500th career singles match victory in the quarterfinals, beating world No. 18 Flavia Pennetta, and subsequently won the tournament with wins over Venus Williams in the semifinals and [[Dinara Safina]] in the final. This was her 41st WTA Tour singles title and first in more than four years. Hingis then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open before losing to Kim Clijsters.

At Wimbledon, Hingis lost in the third round to [[Ai Sugiyama]].

Hingis's return to the US Open was short lived, as she was upset in the second round by world No. 112 [[Virginie Razzano]] of France.

In her first tournament after the US Open, Hingis won the second title of her comeback at the Tier III [[Sunfeast Open]] in [[Kolkata, India]]. She defeated unseeded Russian [[Olga Puchkova]] in the final. The following week in [[Hansol Korea Open Tennis Championships|Seoul]], Hingis notched her 50th match win of the year before losing in the second round to Sania Mirza.

Hingis qualified for the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]] in Madrid as the 8th seed. In her round robin matches, she lost in three sets to both [[Justine Henin]] and [[Amélie Mauresmo]] but defeated [[Nadia Petrova]].

Hingis ended the year ranked world No. 7. She also finished eighth in prize money earnings (US$1,159,537). Hingis also ranked as No. 7 on the Annual Top Google News Searches in 2006.<ref>[http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/google-zeitgeist-highlights-2006-searches/ Google Zeitgeist Highlights 2006 Searches].

===2007===
[[File:Hingis Martina.jpg|thumb|Martina Hingis in Miami, Florida, 2007]]
At the [[2007 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Hingis won her first three rounds without losing a set before defeating China's [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]] in the fourth round. Hingis then lost a quarterfinal match to Kim Clijsters. This was the second consecutive year that Hingis had lost to Clijsters in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/25/tennis.australianopen2007 |title=Hingis comeback quest suffers repeat rebuff from Clijsters |accessdate=25 January 2007 |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Steve |last=Bierley |date=25 January 2007}}</ref> and the third time in the last five [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments that Clijsters had eliminated Hingis in the quarterfinals.

Hingis won her next tournament, the Tier I [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]] in Tokyo, defeating [[Ana Ivanovic]] in the final. This was Hingis's record fifth singles title at this event.

A hip injury that troubled her at the [[German Open (WTA)|German Open]] caused her to withdraw from the [[Rome Masters]], where she was the defending champion, and the French Open, the only important singles title that eluded her.

In her first round match at Wimbledon, Hingis saved two match points to defeat British wildcard [[Naomi Cavaday]], apparently not having fully recovered from the hip injury that prevented her from playing the French Open.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-25/200706251182793470187.html |title=I'm Not a Contender, Says Hingis |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2008 |author=Kate Battersby |publisher=[[AELTC]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125015438/http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-25/200706251182793470187.html |archivedate=25 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> In the third round, Hingis lost to [[Laura Granville]] of the United States, and stated afterwards she should not have entered the tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-29/200706291183145043812.html |title=Injury-hit Hingis Regrets Playing |publisher=AELTC |date=29 June 2007 |author=Kate Battersby |accessdate=5 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125015442/http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-29/200706291183145043812.html |archivedate=25 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

Hingis's next tournament was the last Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, in which Hingis lost in the third round to Belarusian teenager [[Victoria Azarenka]].
